Well, Adam Smith was the first <span class="ansi31">[-point-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+one+}</span> I <span class="ansi31">[-had-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+know+}</span> to have made this <span class="ansi32">point</span> that projectors, I think he called them, are overly optimistic. <span class="ansi31">[-People-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+So people+}</span> who do startups are overly optimistic. People who have <span class="ansi31">[-well entrenched-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+well-entrenched+}</span> VC <span class="ansi31">[-franchise.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+franchises+}</span> make a lot of <span class="ansi32">money</span> and there's some kind of bifurcation in the <span class="ansi31">[-distribution. All right, then-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+distribution, right? Then+}</span> there's a lot of others who are just playing at it and maybe hoping to break even. So the rate of return on private <span class="ansi31">[-investment.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+investment, if you include... I mean,+}</span> if you include small businesses, it's highly skewed, and just a <span class="ansi32">few</span> percent of the people doing this make anything at all. So there's a lot to what <span class="ansi31">[-Cain-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Kane+}</span> said. I don't think he described it adequately in terms of a probability distribution. <span class="ansi32">{+But then again, he+}</span> probably didn't have the <span class="ansi31">[-data and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+data. But+}</span> I wouldn't reject it out of hand.<span class="ansi31">[-&gt;&gt;-]</span> Another example here <span class="ansi31">[-is. is this-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+is... This+}</span> is something your <span class="ansi31">[-colleague, I was talking-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+colleague Alex Tobrock talks+}</span> about a <span class="ansi32">lot</span> is <span class="ansi31">[-that.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that innovators+}</span> don't internalize most of the gains <span class="ansi31">[-to get-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+they give+}</span> to society. So here's another <span class="ansi31">[-example where You know,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+example, where... I mean,+}</span> the entrepreneur compared to one of <span class="ansi31">[-us for some employees-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+his first employees,+}</span> is <span class="ansi32">{+he+}</span> that much better off for taking the extra risk and working that <span class="ansi31">[-way.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+much harder?+}</span> What does this tell us <span class="ansi31">[-about? Is it is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about... It's+}</span> a <span class="ansi31">[-Marvel sense?-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+marvelous insight+}</span> that<span class="ansi31">[-you know-]</span> we're actually more <span class="ansi31">[-of a seeking-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+risk-seeking+}</span> than <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it's+}</span> selfishly good for us. That was <span class="ansi31">[-Rufan-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Reuven+}</span> Brenner's claim in some of his books on risk. Again, I<span class="ansi31">[-I-]</span> think you have to distinguish between different parts of the distribution. So it seems there's a very <span class="ansi31">[-large...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+large+}</span> number of people who foolishly start small businesses. Maybe they overly value <span class="ansi31">[-a when they ought to just get a job with a relatively stable company.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+autonomy,+}</span> when they ought to just get a job with a relatively stable company. <span class="ansi31">[-They're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+So their+}</span> part of the thesis is correct. And I doubt if there's really big social returns to whatever those people <span class="ansi32">do</span> even if they could make <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+a+}</span> go <span class="ansi31">[-with-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of+}</span> it. But there's another part of the <span class="ansi32">distribution</span> people who are actually innovating or have realistic <span class="ansi31">[-prospective-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+prospects of+}</span> doing <span class="ansi31">[-so. or-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+so, where+}</span> I do think those social returns are very high. Now that 2% <span class="ansi32">figure thats</span> cited a lot. I don't think it's really based in much real. It's maybe not a crazy <span class="ansi31">[-seat of the pants-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+seat-of-the-pants+}</span> estimate, but people think like, <span class="ansi32">oh</span> we know it's <span class="ansi32">{+2%.+}</span> And we really don't. So look at Picasso, right? He helped generate <span class="ansi31">[-wisdom-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Cubism+}</span> with <span class="ansi31">[-Brock-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Braque+}</span> and some other artists. How good is our estimate of Picasso's <span class="ansi32">{+income+}</span> compared to the spinoffs from <span class="ansi32">picasso</span> We just don't really <span class="ansi31">[-know.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+know, right?+}</span> We don't know it's <span class="ansi32">2 it</span> could be 1%. It could be 6%. How different do you think it is in art <span class="ansi32">versus</span> I don't <span class="ansi31">[-know entrepreneurship? is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+know, entrepreneur? Entrepreneurship versus+}</span> different kinds of entrepreneurship. There's different industries there as well, right? I'm not sure it's that <span class="ansi32">different</span> So say if some people start blogging, a lot of people copy them. <span class="ansi32">{+Right. Well, some people+}</span> start painting in a particular <span class="ansi32">style a</span> lot of people copy them. I'm not saying the numbers <span class="ansi31">[-But-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+are the same, but+}</span> they don't sound like issues that in principle are so different. <span class="ansi32">{+In 2%,+}</span> overestimate or <span class="ansi32">underestimate it</span> might be <span class="ansi32">wrong</span> but in which <span class="ansi31">[-ways are wrong. I see if the pan says to me-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+way is+}</span> it <span class="ansi32">{+wrong? My seat-of-the-pants estimate+}</span> would <span class="ansi31">[-be...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+be 2%+}</span> to <span class="ansi32">5 so</span> I think it's pretty close. But <span class="ansi32">again</span> that's not based on anything <span class="ansi31">[-firm.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I can confirm.+}</span> Here's another quote from <span class="ansi31">[-Kains.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes.+}</span> Investment based on genuine long-term <span class="ansi31">[-experience. is so difficult as to be scarcely you practical, Google. Who-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+expectation+}</span> is so difficult as to be scarcely <span class="ansi32">{+practicable.

So one <span class="ansi31">[-may-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+way to+}</span> look at this is <span class="ansi32">like oh</span> he just doesn't understand efficient market <span class="ansi32">hypothesis its</span> like before random <span class="ansi32">{+walks or something.+}</span> But there's things you can see in the market <span class="ansi32">today</span> where, you know, are the prospects for future dividends so much higher after COVID than they were immediately after the <span class="ansi31">[-crisis. are the prospects for future dividend so much higher after COVID than they were immediately-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+crash?+}</span> How much of market behavior can be explained by these sorts of <span class="ansi31">[-claims?-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+claims from Keynes?+}</span> I think <span class="ansi31">[-Kane said-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes had+}</span> the view that for his time, you could be a <span class="ansi31">[-short run-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+short-run+}</span> speculator and in fact beat the markets. And he believed that he did <span class="ansi32">so and</span> at least he did for some periods of his life. That may have been <span class="ansi32">luck</span> or maybe he did <span class="ansi32">have</span> special insight. It probably wasn't true in general, <span class="ansi32">though we</span> don't really <span class="ansi31">[-know a bit of It's all-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+know, did efficient markets hold+}</span> during, you know, <span class="ansi31">[-great in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Britain+}</span> at that time. Maybe they're just <span class="ansi31">[-for a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+more+}</span> profit <span class="ansi31">[-opportunity.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+opportunities+}</span> for smarter than average people. So that's a <span class="ansi31">[-good thing for the 1980s for smarter than average people.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+view.+}</span> I'm inclined not to believe <span class="ansi32">it but again</span> I don't think it's absurd. <span class="ansi32">{+Keynes+}</span> is <span class="ansi32">saying</span> for people who want money, this is biased toward the short <span class="ansi32">term you</span> can get your profits and get out. And that's damaging <span class="ansi31">[-long term investment. in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+long-term investment,+}</span> which in <span class="ansi31">[-fact you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+fact, he+}</span> wanted to socialize. So he's being led to a very bad place by the <span class="ansi32">{+argument.+}</span> But again, we shouldn't dismiss it out of hand. Why is it not easy<span class="ansi31">[-to...-]</span> to retrospectively study<span class="ansi31">[-what-]</span> how efficient markets were back then in the same way we can study it now in terms of like, <span class="ansi31">[-oh-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+oh,+}</span> you look at the <span class="ansi31">[-price earnings-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+price-to-earnings+}</span> ratios and then <span class="ansi32">{+what were+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-hot over the dividend.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+dividends+}</span> afterwards over the coming decades for those companies based on their <span class="ansi31">[-sacrifice-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+stock price+}</span> or <span class="ansi32">something</span> I don't <span class="ansi32">know</span> how many publicly traded firms <span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+there+}</span> were in Britain at that time. I don't know how good the <span class="ansi31">[-day are things-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+data are. Things+}</span> like <span class="ansi31">[-bid asks spread. At-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bid-ask spread at+}</span> what price you actually <span class="ansi31">[-execute-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+executed+}</span> trades can really matter for testing efficient <span class="ansi31">[-market-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+markets+}</span> hypothesis. <span class="ansi31">[-Probably-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+So probably+}</span> we can't <span class="ansi32">tell</span> even though there must be share price data of some <span class="ansi32">sort at</span> what <span class="ansi32">{+frequency? Well, is it once a day? Is it once a week?+}</span> We don't have the sort of data we have now <span class="ansi31">[-or-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+where+}</span> you can just test anything you want. <span class="ansi32">{+You also made an+}</span> interesting point is <span class="ansi32">{+like,+}</span> not only is it not <span class="ansi32">profitable</span> but even if you <span class="ansi32">succeed</span> society will look at the contrarian in a very negative light. <span class="ansi32">{+You will+}</span> be like doubly punished for being a contrarian. But <span class="ansi31">[-this is gonna be the case, right? Like you have somebody like Warren B for being a contrarian. But this is gonna-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that doesn't seem to+}</span> be the case, right? Like <span class="ansi31">[-you have-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+if+}</span> somebody like Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger, <span class="ansi31">[-would get our activity-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+people who do beat the market are actually pretty+}</span> revered. They're not punished in public opinion. And they pursued <span class="ansi31">[-most-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+mostly+}</span> long-term strategies. <span class="ansi32">{+Right.+}</span> But again, trying to make sense of <span class="ansi31">[-canes,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes,+}</span> if you think about long-term investing and I don't think he meant Buffett style investing. I think he meant building <span class="ansi32">factories</span> trying to figure out what people would want to buy 25 years from that point in time. <span class="ansi32">that</span> probably was much harder than today. <span class="ansi31">[-See-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+So+}</span> you <span class="ansi31">[-at---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+had way+}</span> less access to <span class="ansi32">data your</span> ability to build an international<span class="ansi31">[-solution.-]</span> supply chain was much <span class="ansi31">[-weaker geopolitical-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+weaker. Geopolitical+}</span> turmoil at various <span class="ansi31">[-points. and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+points in+}</span> time was much higher. So again, it's not a crazy view. I think there's a lot in <span class="ansi31">[-cane. it's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes that's+}</span> very much of his <span class="ansi31">[-time, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+time that+}</span> he presents out of a kind of overconfidence as being <span class="ansi32">{+general.+}</span> And it's not general. It may not even be <span class="ansi32">true but</span> there were some <span class="ansi32">{+reasons. There were some+}</span> reasons why you could <span class="ansi31">[-leave-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+believe+}</span> it. Another quote from <span class="ansi31">[-Kains,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes.+}</span> I guess I <span class="ansi31">[-want to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+won't+}</span> read the whole <span class="ansi31">[-quoted-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+quote in+}</span> full, but basically says over time as investments <span class="ansi31">[-are-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+or+}</span> markets get more <span class="ansi32">mature</span> more and more of equities are held basically by passive investors, people who don't have <span class="ansi32">a</span> direct hand in the <span class="ansi31">[-moment-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+involvement+}</span> of the enterprise. And the share of the market that's passive <span class="ansi31">[-investment.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+investment now+}</span> is much bigger. Should we be worried about this? As long as <span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+at+}</span> the margin people can do <span class="ansi32">things</span> I'm not very worried about it. So there's two different kinds of worries. One is that no one monitors the<span class="ansi31">[-[AUDIO OUT-]</span> value of companies. It seems to me those incentives aren't weaker. There's more <span class="ansi31">[-reason. search-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+research+}</span> than ever <span class="ansi31">[-before, is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+before. There's+}</span> maybe a <span class="ansi32">problem not</span> enough companies are publicly <span class="ansi32">held but</span> you can always, if you know <span class="ansi32">something</span> the rest of the market doesn't buy <span class="ansi31">[-yourself-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+or sell+}</span> short and do better. The other <span class="ansi31">[-worries,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+worry is+}</span> those passive investors have economies of scale and <span class="ansi31">[-the lender.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+they'll end up+}</span> colluding with each <span class="ansi32">other and</span> you'll <span class="ansi32">have say</span> like three to five mutual <span class="ansi31">[-funds of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+funds, private+}</span> equity firms owning a big chunk of the market portfolio. And in essence, <span class="ansi31">[-direct directly,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+directly or indirectly,+}</span> they'll tell those firms not to compete. <span class="ansi31">[-So,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+It's+}</span> a weird form of collusion. They don't issue explicit instructions, like say the same few mutual funds<span class="ansi31">[-zone. explicit instructions like say the same few mutual funds-]</span> own <span class="ansi31">[-coca should co-compet c-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Coke and Pepsi. Should Coke and Pepsi+}</span> compete or should they collude? <span class="ansi32">well</span> they might just pick <span class="ansi31">[-lazy. your-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+lazier+}</span> managers who in some way give you implicit collusion. <span class="ansi32">{+Maybe this is another+}</span> example of the innovators being unable to internalize their <span class="ansi31">[-games as-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+gains. There's+}</span> an active <span class="ansi31">[-investor is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+investors+}</span> who are providing this information <span class="ansi31">[-in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+to+}</span> the market. They don't make <span class="ansi32">{+out+}</span> that much better than the passive investors, but they're <span class="ansi31">[-service but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+actually providing a valuable service. But+}</span> the benefits are diffused throughout society. I think <span class="ansi31">[-over confident.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+overconfidence helps us on that front.+}</span> So there's<span class="ansi31">[-corn on-]</span> quote <span class="ansi32">{+unquote+}</span> too much trading from a private point of view. <span class="ansi32">{+But from a+}</span> social point of <span class="ansi31">[-view-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+view,+}</span> maybe you <span class="ansi31">[-could-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+can+}</span> only have too much trading or too little trading and you might <span class="ansi32">{+rather+}</span> have too much trading. <span class="ansi31">[-I explain that why wiser but by-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Explain that. Why+}</span> can it only be too much <span class="ansi32">{+or too little?+}</span> Well, let's say the relevant choice variable is investor temperament. <span class="ansi31">[-Yes,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+So yes,+}</span> you'd prefer <span class="ansi31">[-it if-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it. I mean, I'm sure+}</span> everyone had the temperament just to do what was socially optimal. <span class="ansi32">{+But if temperament+}</span> is some inclination in <span class="ansi32">you</span> and you can just be <span class="ansi31">[-confident-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+overconfident+}</span> or not confident enough and <span class="ansi31">[-over confident excuse-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+overconfidence gives+}</span> you too much <span class="ansi31">[-That-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+trading, that+}</span> might be the best we can do. Again, fine tuning would be best of all. <span class="ansi32">{+But+}</span> I've never seen humans where you could just fine tune all their emotions to the point where they ought to be. <span class="ansi31">[-Yeah,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Yeah. Okay, so+}</span> we can ask <span class="ansi31">[-a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> question, how far above optimal are <span class="ansi32">we or</span> if we are above <span class="ansi32">optimal in</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-chapter K and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+chapter, Cain+}</span> says that over time <span class="ansi31">[-is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+as+}</span> markets <span class="ansi31">[-going to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+get+}</span> more mature, they become more <span class="ansi31">[-of and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+speculative. And+}</span> the example he gives <span class="ansi31">[-is a newer-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+us, like the New York+}</span> market seems more speculative to him than the London market at the time. But today,<span class="ansi31">[-if-]</span> finances 8% of <span class="ansi31">[-GDP, is that...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+GDP. Is that+}</span> what we should expect it to be to <span class="ansi31">[-officially-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+efficiently+}</span> allocate <span class="ansi31">[-capital. You-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+capital? Is there some reason we can+}</span> just look at that number and <span class="ansi31">[-you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+pretty much+}</span> say that that's too <span class="ansi32">big</span> I think <span class="ansi31">[-through-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> relevant number for the financial <span class="ansi32">sector</span> is what percentage it is of wealth, not GDP. So <span class="ansi31">[-your management in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you're managing wealth. And+}</span> the financial sector has been a pretty constant 2% of wealth for a few<span class="ansi31">[-days.-]</span> decades in the United States with bumps, obviously 2008 matters, but it's more <span class="ansi32">{+or+}</span> less <span class="ansi31">[-2% and that makes it sound a lot less sinister. It's not actually the growing at the expense-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+2%.+}</span> And that makes it sound a lot less sinister. It's not actually like growing at the expense of <span class="ansi31">[-something.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+something and eating+}</span> up the economy. So you would prefer <span class="ansi31">[-its lesson to. right, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it's less than 2%, right? But+}</span> 2% does not sound outrageously high to me. <span class="ansi32">{+And if+}</span> the ratio of wealth to GDP grows over time, which it tends to do when you have durable capital and no major wars, the financial sector will grow relative to GDP. <span class="ansi31">[-And-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+But again,+}</span> that's not sinister. Think of it in terms of wealth.<span class="ansi31">[---]</span> I see. So one way to think about it is <span class="ansi32">{+like the management cost+}</span> as a fraction of the assets <span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+under+}</span> management or something. <span class="ansi31">[-- Yeah, okay,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+That's right. In that case, 2% is not that bad. Yeah. Okay,+}</span> interesting. I <span class="ansi31">[-wanna-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+want to+}</span> go back to the risk aversion thing <span class="ansi31">[-again, 'cause...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+again because+}</span> I don't know how to think about this. So his whole thing <span class="ansi32">is</span> these animal spirits, they guide us to make all <span class="ansi31">[-the... and English-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+these bets+}</span> and <span class="ansi32">{+engage in+}</span> all <span class="ansi31">[-his-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+this+}</span> activity. In some sense, he's saying <span class="ansi32">like</span> not only <span class="ansi31">[-every not-risk new show,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+are we not risk neutral,+}</span> but we're more <span class="ansi31">[-risky-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+risk seeking+}</span> than <span class="ansi32">is rational whereas</span> the way <span class="ansi31">[-you can initially-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you'd conventionally+}</span> think about it is that humans are <span class="ansi31">[-risk-averse,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+risk averse,+}</span> right? <span class="ansi31">[-they have, they-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+They+}</span> prefer to take less risk than <span class="ansi31">[-this-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+is+}</span> rational in some sense. How do we score this? Well, <span class="ansi32">here</span> Milton <span class="ansi31">[-treatment and other-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Friedman, another+}</span> goat <span class="ansi32">contender</span> comes into the picture. So his <span class="ansi31">[-name is Peace the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+famous piece with+}</span> Savage makes the point that risk aversion is essentially context dependent. So he was a behavioral economist before we knew of such things. So the same people typically will buy insurance and <span class="ansi31">[-gamble gambling.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+gamble. Gambling, you can+}</span> interpret quite broadly. And that's the right way to think about it. So just flat out risk <span class="ansi32">{+aversion+}</span> or <span class="ansi31">[-risk-cliving-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+risk loving+}</span> behavior, it doesn't really exist. Almost everyone is <span class="ansi31">[-context-dependent. And-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+context dependent. Now,+}</span> why you choose the context you do, maybe it's some kind of <span class="ansi31">[-extra size and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+exercise in+}</span> mood management. So you <span class="ansi31">[-ensure-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+insure+}</span> your house so you can sleep <span class="ansi31">[-while-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+well+}</span> at <span class="ansi31">[-night.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+night, you+}</span> fire insurance, <span class="ansi31">[-but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+and+}</span> then you get a little <span class="ansi32">bored and</span> to stimulate <span class="ansi31">[-yourself.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+yourself, you're+}</span> betting on these NBA <span class="ansi32">games and yes</span> that's <span class="ansi32">foolish</span> but it keeps you busy and it <span class="ansi32">{+helps+}</span> you follow analytics and you read about the games <span class="ansi32">online and</span> maybe that's efficient <span class="ansi31">[-mood. management and that's the way to think about our risk behavior. I don't bend by the way.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+mood management.+}</span> And that's the way to think about<span class="ansi31">[-our-]</span> risk behavior. I don't <span class="ansi31">[-bet-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bet,+}</span> by the way. <span class="ansi31">[-Say-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I mean, you could say+}</span> I bet with my career, but I don't <span class="ansi31">[-dead-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bet+}</span> on things. Well, what is the way <span class="ansi32">{+in,+}</span> what's your <span class="ansi31">[-in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+version of+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-water check it was-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+lottery chicken? What is+}</span> the thing where you <span class="ansi32">just</span> for the entertainment value or the <span class="ansi31">[-to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+distraction value, you+}</span> take more risk than would <span class="ansi31">[-see-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+seem+}</span> rational? <span class="ansi32">{+Well, like+}</span> writing the book <span class="ansi32">goat</span> which is not with any known <span class="ansi32">publisher its</span> just online. <span class="ansi32">its free its</span> published within GPT-4. <span class="ansi31">[-Tuck-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Took+}</span> me quite a <span class="ansi31">[-while.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+while to write the book.+}</span> I'm not sure there's a huge <span class="ansi32">downside</span> but it's risky in the <span class="ansi31">[-set. So-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+sense of+}</span> it's not what anyone else was doing. So that was a kind of <span class="ansi32">risk</span> I invested a lot of my <span class="ansi32">{+writing time+}</span> in something <span class="ansi32">weird and</span> I've done things like that pretty frequently. So that keeps me, you could <span class="ansi32">say</span> excited. Or like starting <span class="ansi31">[-at more you,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+MRU,+}</span> you know, the online <span class="ansi32">education</span> videos and economics. <span class="ansi31">[-No, CUNY are-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+No pecuniary+}</span> return to me at <span class="ansi32">all indirectly</span> it costs me a lot of money. That's a sort of risk. I feel it's paid off for me in a <span class="ansi32">big way but</span> on one <span class="ansi32">hand</span> you can <span class="ansi32">say well tyler</span> what <span class="ansi31">[-are-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+do+}</span> you actually have from <span class="ansi32">that and</span> the answer is nothing. Yeah. Well, <span class="ansi31">[-the situation is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+this actually raises+}</span> the question <span class="ansi32">{+I was going to+}</span> ask about these <span class="ansi31">[-co-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Go+}</span> contenders in general and how you're judging <span class="ansi31">[-them, where you're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+them. You're+}</span> looking at <span class="ansi31">[-the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+their+}</span> work as a <span class="ansi32">whole given that</span> I don't <span class="ansi32">know</span> some of these risks pay off that these <span class="ansi31">[-take-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+intellectuals take,+}</span> some of them don't pay off. Should we just be looking at their top contributions and just disregard everything <span class="ansi32">else</span> For Hayek, I think one of the points you have against him is that his <span class="ansi31">[-talk through-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+top three+}</span> articles are <span class="ansi32">amazing</span> but after that, there's a drop off. The top <span class="ansi31">[-risk-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+risks+}</span> you <span class="ansi32">take</span> are <span class="ansi32">{+they+}</span> the only ones that <span class="ansi32">matter why</span> are we looking at the other stuff? I don't think <span class="ansi31">[-through-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+they're+}</span> the only ones that matter, but I'll <span class="ansi31">[-wait-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+weight+}</span> them pretty heavily. <span class="ansi32">{+But+}</span> your failures do <span class="ansi31">[-reflect usually and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+reflect, usually, in+}</span> how you think or what you know about the world. So <span class="ansi31">[-high ex-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Hayek's+}</span> failures, for instance, <span class="ansi31">[-is an ability-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+his inability+}</span> to come up with <span class="ansi31">[-a normal of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the normative+}</span> standard in <span class="ansi32">constitution</span> of <span class="ansi32">liberty it</span> shows in some ways he just <span class="ansi31">[-was not-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wasn't+}</span> rigorous enough. He was content with the kind of Germanic, put a lot of complex <span class="ansi31">[-is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ideas+}</span> out there and hope they're profound. And you see that even in his best work. <span class="ansi31">[-and hope they're profound. And you see-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Now,+}</span> that<span class="ansi31">[-even in his best work. That-]</span> is profound, but it's not as if the failures and the best work for all these people are <span class="ansi31">[-unrelated and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+unrelated.

Like, Keynes,+}</span> more or <span class="ansi31">[-less change to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+less, changed his mind every year.+}</span> That's a strength, but it's also a weakness. And by considering <span class="ansi31">[-Keynes is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes'+}</span> really <span class="ansi32">{+good+}</span> works and bad <span class="ansi32">works</span> like his defenses of <span class="ansi31">[-terrorists.

And the best work he also moved on from in some <span class="ansi32">way if</span> you read <span class="ansi32">how</span> to <span class="ansi32">pay</span> for the <span class="ansi31">[-war, If-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+War in 1940, if+}</span> you didn't know <span class="ansi31">[-that or-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+better,+}</span> you would think <span class="ansi31">[-of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it's+}</span> someone criticizing the general theory. <span class="ansi31">[-How this-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Does+}</span> quantity have a quality<span class="ansi31">[-of-]</span> all of <span class="ansi31">[-this so in any thinking? grid intellectuals, where-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+its own when you think of great intellectuals?

For+}</span> the best <span class="ansi32">people</span> it's necessary. So John <span class="ansi31">[-Stewart-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Stuart+}</span> Mill wrote an enormous amount. <span class="ansi32">{+Most+}</span> of it's quite <span class="ansi32">interesting but</span> his ability to see things from multiple <span class="ansi32">perspectives</span> I <span class="ansi32">think</span> was in part stemming from the fact that he wrote a lot about many different <span class="ansi31">[-topics.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+topics, like+}</span> French history, ancient <span class="ansi32">greece he</span> had real depth and breadth. If Keynes is alive today, what are the odds that he's in a <span class="ansi31">[-poly-Hulin-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+polycule in+}</span> Berkeley writing <span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> best <span class="ansi31">[-run-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+written,+}</span> less <span class="ansi31">[-run-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wrong+}</span> post you've ever <span class="ansi32">seen</span> I'm not sure what the <span class="ansi31">[-counter factual-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+counterfactual+}</span> means. So <span class="ansi31">[-Cain-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Keynes+}</span> is so <span class="ansi32">british maybe</span> he's an effective <span class="ansi31">[-truest-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+altruist+}</span> at <span class="ansi31">[-Cambridge and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Cambridge. And, you know,+}</span> given how he <span class="ansi31">[-seen-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+seems+}</span> to have run a sex <span class="ansi32">life</span> I don't think he needed a polycule. <span class="ansi31">[-A capolycule is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Like+}</span> a <span class="ansi32">{+polycule is+}</span> almost a <span class="ansi31">[-William Sony and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Williamsonian+}</span> device to economize on transactions costs. <span class="ansi31">[-According-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+But Keynes, according+}</span> to his own <span class="ansi32">notes</span> seems to have done things on a very casual basis. <span class="ansi31">[-- Yeah,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+He had a spreadsheet, right, of his sexual partner?

How do you think about the <span class="ansi31">[-long-term-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+long term+}</span> value of and the <span class="ansi31">[-electron-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+long term+}</span> impact of intellectuals you disagree <span class="ansi32">with</span> So do you think over the course of history, <span class="ansi32">basically</span> the improvements they make to the discourse and the additional things they give us a chance to think <span class="ansi31">[-about.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about that washes+}</span> out <span class="ansi31">[-there, object-level,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+their object level,+}</span> the things that <span class="ansi31">[-are object-level-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+were object level+}</span> wrong <span class="ansi31">[-about, or what-- Let's work-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about or. Well, it's worked+}</span> that way so far. <span class="ansi31">[-We've-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Right. So we've+}</span> had economic <span class="ansi31">[-growth-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+growth, obviously+}</span> with <span class="ansi31">[-interruption.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+interruptions.+}</span> But so much has fed into the <span class="ansi32">stream and</span> you have to be pretty happy with today's world compared <span class="ansi31">[-with the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+with, say,+}</span> 1880. The future may or may not bring us the same. But if the future brings us continuing economic growth, then I'm going to say exactly that. <span class="ansi31">[-I hope you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I'll be+}</span> happy they fed into the stream. They may have been wrong, but things really worked out. But if the future brings us in a shrinking <span class="ansi32">population</span> asymptotically <span class="ansi31">[-your project.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+approaching+}</span> a very low level and greater poverty and more <span class="ansi31">[-war than-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+war, then+}</span> you've got to <span class="ansi31">[-under way. Who-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wonder, well, who+}</span> is responsible for that? <span class="ansi32">{+Right.+}</span> Who would be responsible for that? We don't know, but I think secular thinkers will fall in relative <span class="ansi31">[-status. of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+status if+}</span> that's the outcome and that's most prominent intellectuals <span class="ansi31">[-today. I still concluded. Yeah, who-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+today, myself included. Yeah. Who+}</span> would rise in status as a result? Well, there's a number of <span class="ansi31">[-people-- Complaining strenuously-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+people complaining strenuously about fertility. There's a number of people complaining+}</span> about <span class="ansi31">[-fertility declines.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the decline.

But+}</span> I basically never see the <span class="ansi31">[-is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+pacifists+}</span> rising in status for any more than brief <span class="ansi32">moments like</span> after the Vietnam <span class="ansi32">war maybe</span> they <span class="ansi32">did</span> after <span class="ansi31">[-Oberon.

Anyways. Yeah.+}</span> But those people could end up as much more important than they are now. <span class="ansi31">[-Okay,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Yeah. OK,+}</span> let's talk about Hayek. Sure. So before we get into his actual <span class="ansi32">views</span> I think his career is a tremendous white pill in the sense that he writes <span class="ansi31">[-the wrote his story of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+The Road to Serfdom+}</span> in <span class="ansi32">1944</span> when Nazi Germany and Soviet Union are both prominent players. And <span class="ansi31">[-honestly, like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+he's a very honest person. And he's a very honest person. He's a very honest person. And I think+}</span> the way things <span class="ansi31">[-shake out.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+shaped out,+}</span> I mean, he would be pretty pleased that a lot of the biggest <span class="ansi31">[-collectivism-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+collectivisms+}</span> of the day have <span class="ansi32">been</span> wiped out. So it is <span class="ansi31">[-from in Swipeville.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+a tremendous white pill.+}</span> You can have a career like that. He <span class="ansi32">was</span> not as right as he thought at the time, but he ended up being too grumpy in his later years. <span class="ansi32">{+Really?+}</span> He thought, well, collectivism is still going to engulf the world. And I think he became a grumpy old man. <span class="ansi31">[-And it may be it's one thing to be-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+He was+}</span> a grumpy old <span class="ansi31">[-man. 2024, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+man before. But+}</span> to be a grumpy old man in the 80s didn't seem justified. What was <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> cause? What<span class="ansi31">[-was-]</span> specifically <span class="ansi31">[-to DC?-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+did he see that he? He thought+}</span> they were <span class="ansi31">[-at a vistic-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+atavistic+}</span> instincts in the human spirit, which were biologically built <span class="ansi32">in</span> that led us to be <span class="ansi31">[-collectivists and to envy us-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+collectivists. Right. And too envious+}</span> and not appreciative of how <span class="ansi31">[-important. and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+impersonal+}</span> orders worked and that this would cause the West to turn into something quite crummy. I wouldn't say he's been proven wrong, but<span class="ansi31">[-a lot of the West has had a pretty good run. I wouldn't say-]</span> he's<span class="ansi31">[-been proven wrong, but a lot of the West has-]</span> had a pretty good run since <span class="ansi31">[-and does-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+then. And there's+}</span> not major evidence that he's correct. The bad events we've seen, like some <span class="ansi31">[-more-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+war+}</span> coming <span class="ansi32">back</span> something weird happening in our <span class="ansi32">politics</span> I'm not sure how to describe it. I'm not sure they fit the <span class="ansi31">[-high-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Hayek+}</span> model,<span class="ansi31">[-a-]</span> sort of simply the accretion of more socialism. But in terms of the basic psychological urges towards <span class="ansi31">[-enemy-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+envy+}</span> and <span class="ansi31">[-resentment.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+resentment, isn't the+}</span> rise of <span class="ansi31">[-wokeness, the prevent-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wokeness provide+}</span> evidence for his <span class="ansi32">view</span> But now <span class="ansi31">[-we'll miss,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wokeness.+}</span> I <span class="ansi31">[-would say his peak that's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+would say is peaked and is falling. That's+}</span> a big debate. I don't see wokeness as our biggest problem. I <span class="ansi32">see</span> excessive bureaucracy, <span class="ansi31">[-square-iotic-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+sclerotic+}</span> institutions, <span class="ansi31">[-clutch accuracy, and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+kludgeocracy as+}</span> bigger problems. <span class="ansi32">{+They're+}</span> not unrelated to <span class="ansi32">openness</span> to be <span class="ansi32">clear but</span> I think they're more fundamental and harder to fix. Let's talk about <span class="ansi31">[-Hikes Hikes-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Hayek's+}</span> arguments. So obviously he has a famous <span class="ansi32">argument</span> about decentralization. But when we look at companies like Amazon, Uber, <span class="ansi31">[-they're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+these other+}</span> big <span class="ansi31">[-companies. They-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+tech companies, they+}</span> actually do a pretty good job of central planning, right? There's like a sea of <span class="ansi32">{+logistics+}</span> and drivers and <span class="ansi31">[-trade-offs-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+trade offs+}</span> that they <span class="ansi31">[-had-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+have+}</span> to square. Do they provide evidence <span class="ansi31">[-as a new-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that central+}</span> planning can work? Well, I'm not a <span class="ansi31">[-co-sean.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Kosian. So Kosian in his+}</span> famous 1937 article said the firm is <span class="ansi32">planning and</span> he contrasted that to the market. <span class="ansi32">{+Right.+}</span> I think the firm is the market. The firm is always making contracts <span class="ansi31">[-in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+and+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-market.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+market is subject+}</span> to market checks and balances. To me, it's <span class="ansi31">[-not-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+not, you know,+}</span> an <span class="ansi31">[-island, a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+island of+}</span> central planning and the broader froth of the market. So I'm just not <span class="ansi31">[-co-cian.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Kosian.+}</span> So people are <span class="ansi32">{+Kosian.+}</span> This is an embarrassing question for them. But I'll just say Amazon being great is the market <span class="ansi32">working</span> and they're not centrally planning. Even the Soviet Union, it was very bad, but it didn't end up being <span class="ansi31">[-that co-plining. You-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+central planning. It+}</span> started off that way for a few years. So I think people <span class="ansi31">[-may... this interpret-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+misinterpret+}</span> large business firms in many <span class="ansi31">[-ways. I'm-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ways on+}</span> both the left and the right. <span class="ansi31">[-But-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Wait, but+}</span> under this argument, it still adds to the credence of <span class="ansi32">the</span> people who argue that basically we need the government to control<span class="ansi31">[-them-]</span> because if it is the <span class="ansi31">[-case it's over union is still we need the government to control because if it is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+case,+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-case that's over-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Soviet+}</span> Union is still <span class="ansi31">[-on-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+not+}</span> central <span class="ansi32">planning people</span> would say, well, <span class="ansi32">{+but+}</span> yeah, <span class="ansi32">{+but+}</span> that's kind of what I want in terms <span class="ansi31">[-of, they're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of there's+}</span> still kind of <span class="ansi32">checks</span> in terms of import exports of the market test is still applied to the government in that sense. <span class="ansi32">whats</span> wrong with that <span class="ansi31">[-argument? Basically,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+argument that basically+}</span> you can treat the government as <span class="ansi31">[-a back-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that+}</span> kind of <span class="ansi31">[-firm.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+firm? I'm not sure I+}</span> followed your question. I would say <span class="ansi32">this</span> I view the later Soviet <span class="ansi32">union</span> as being highly <span class="ansi32">decentralized managers</span> optimizing their own rents and setting <span class="ansi31">[-to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+prices too+}</span> low to take in bribes. <span class="ansi31">[-Alof-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I'll+}</span> Paul Craig <span class="ansi32">roberts</span> what he wrote in the 80s. And that's a very bad decentralized system. And it was <span class="ansi32">{+sort of+}</span> backed up by something <span class="ansi31">[-high Central of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+highly central+}</span> Communist Party in the <span class="ansi32">ussr but</span> it's not <span class="ansi32">like</span> the early attempts at true central planning in the Soviet Union in the 20s right after the <span class="ansi32">revolution</span> which did totally fail and were abandoned pretty <span class="ansi32">quickly</span> even by Lenin. <span class="ansi31">[-which is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Would you+}</span> kind of<span class="ansi31">[-the-]</span> 50s period <span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in the+}</span> Soviet Union as more centrally planned than or more <span class="ansi31">[-decentralized. at-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+decentralized by+}</span> that <span class="ansi31">[-point. Decentralized, you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+point? Decentralized.

Obviously, weaponry,+}</span> steel <span class="ansi32">production you</span> have targets. But even that tends to collapse into decentralized <span class="ansi32">{+action+}</span> just with <span class="ansi31">[-Pat and Senis.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bad incentives.+}</span> So your explanation for why did the Soviet Union have <span class="ansi31">[-higher-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+high+}</span> growth in the <span class="ansi32">50s</span> Is it more catch up? Is it more that they weren't communist <span class="ansi31">[-of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+at+}</span> the time? <span class="ansi31">[-I-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+How+}</span> would <span class="ansi31">[-just like a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you explain that? A+}</span> lot of the Soviet high growth was rebuilding after the <span class="ansi31">[-war.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+war, which the central+}</span> planning can do relatively <span class="ansi32">well right you</span> see government rebuilding <span class="ansi31">[-city say-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+cities, say,+}</span> in <span class="ansi32">germany</span> that works pretty <span class="ansi32">well but</span> most of all,<span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span> this is even before World War <span class="ansi31">[-II,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Two,+}</span> just <span class="ansi31">[-urban is a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+urbanization.+}</span> It shouldn't be underrated today, given<span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span> we've observed China. <span class="ansi31">[-but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+But+}</span> so much of Chinese growth was driven by <span class="ansi32">urbanization so</span> much of Soviet growth. You take someone working on a farm producing almost nothing, put them in the city, even under <span class="ansi32">{+a bad system,+}</span> they're going to be a lot more productive. And that drove so much of Soviet growth <span class="ansi32">before</span> after the <span class="ansi32">war but</span> that at some point more or less <span class="ansi31">[-ends, as-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ends. Right. As+}</span> it has. Well, it hasn't quite ended with China, but <span class="ansi31">[-it's certainly slowed down and people don't pay enough attention to hasn't quite ended with China but it's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it+}</span> certainly slowed <span class="ansi32">down and</span> people don't pay enough attention to that. <span class="ansi31">[-and that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I don't know why. It+}</span> seems pretty obvious. <span class="ansi31">[-We're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+But+}</span> going back to the point <span class="ansi31">[-of our-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about+}</span> firms. So I guess the point I was trying to make is I don't understand why the argument <span class="ansi31">[-to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you+}</span> make <span class="ansi31">[-Well,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that, well,+}</span> these firms are still within the market in the sense that they have to pass these <span class="ansi32">{+market tests,+}</span> why that couldn't also apply to <span class="ansi31">[-government-directed production.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+government directed production, because then people argue that.+}</span> Well, sometimes it does.<span class="ansi31">[-Right.-]</span> Government runs a bunch of enterprises. <span class="ansi32">{+They may have monopoly positions,+}</span> but many are open to the <span class="ansi31">[-market and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+market. In+}</span> Singapore, government hospitals compete with private hospitals. <span class="ansi32">{+Government+}</span> hospitals seem to be fine. I know they get some means of <span class="ansi32">support</span> but <span class="ansi32">{+they're+}</span> not all terrible. But I guess <span class="ansi31">[-it's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+as+}</span> a general <span class="ansi32">principle</span> you'd be <span class="ansi32">against</span> more <span class="ansi31">[-direct information-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+government directed production,+}</span> right? <span class="ansi31">[-Well it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Well,+}</span> depends on the <span class="ansi32">context so</span> if <span class="ansi32">its say</span> the military, probably we ought to be building a lot more of some particular <span class="ansi31">[-things.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+things and it will+}</span> be done through Boeing, Lockheed and so <span class="ansi32">on but</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-government is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+government's+}</span> directing <span class="ansi31">[-it paying for it in some way. important role planning it.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it, but it's not going to be done through the military.+}</span> And <span class="ansi32">{+so+}</span> we need to do that. We've at times done that well in the <span class="ansi31">[-passed.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+past.+}</span> So people <span class="ansi31">[-over rate-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+overrate+}</span> the distinction between <span class="ansi31">[-government.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+government and+}</span> market, I think, especially libertarians. But that said, there's an awful lot of government <span class="ansi31">[-see-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bureaucracy+}</span> that's terrible, doesn't have <span class="ansi31">[-the deep-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+a big+}</span> market check, but very often governments <span class="ansi31">[-actually-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+act+}</span> through markets and have to contract or <span class="ansi31">[-higher-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+hire+}</span> consultants or <span class="ansi31">[-higher-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+hire+}</span> outside parties. <span class="ansi32">{+And it's more+}</span> like a market than you think. I want to ask a <span class="ansi31">[-different-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+question. You talked about another+}</span> part of <span class="ansi31">[-high-ex.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Hayek.+}</span> So he has an argument about how it's really hard to aggregate information towards a central <span class="ansi31">[-But then,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+planner, but then+}</span> more <span class="ansi32">recently</span> there have been results in computer science that just finding <span class="ansi31">[-really delivery them as-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the general equilibrium is+}</span> computationally <span class="ansi31">[-intractable. And we would be traced to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+intractable and which raises+}</span> the <span class="ansi32">question well</span> the market is somehow solving this problem, right? <span class="ansi31">[-Set it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Separate+}</span> from the problem, getting <span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> information, making use of <span class="ansi32">{+that+}</span> information to allocate scarce resources. How is that <span class="ansi32">{+computationally+}</span> a<span class="ansi31">[-competition? at-]</span> process <span class="ansi31">[-as possible.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that's possible?+}</span> You know, I'm sure you're <span class="ansi31">[-aware, like you've been-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+aware of+}</span> linear <span class="ansi31">[-up a Non-kend x constraints how does the market solve this problem? Well the market and non-conducts constraints, how-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+optimization, non-convex constraints. How+}</span> does the market solve this problem? Well, the market's not <span class="ansi31">[-solved. and we're like we're living.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+solving for a general equilibrium.+}</span> It's just solving for something that gets us into the next day. <span class="ansi31">[-to be-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+And that's a big+}</span> part of the triumph. Just living to fight another <span class="ansi32">day wealth</span> not going down, not everyone quitting. And if you can do that, things will get better. <span class="ansi31">[-And that's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+That's+}</span> what we're pretty <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+good at+}</span> doing is just building a sustainable <span class="ansi32">structure and</span> a lot of it isn't <span class="ansi31">[-sustainable.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+sustainable, like+}</span> the fools who start these new small <span class="ansi31">[-businesses, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+businesses. And if+}</span> they <span class="ansi32">do</span> pretty quickly disappear. <span class="ansi32">{+And that's part of+}</span> the market as well. So if you view the whole thing in terms of <span class="ansi31">[-computing,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+computing a+}</span> general <span class="ansi32">equilibrium</span> I think <span class="ansi31">[-when our high-acraid-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+one of Hayek's great+}</span> insights is that's just the wrong way to think about the whole problem. So lack of computational ability to do <span class="ansi32">that</span> doesn't worry me for either the market or <span class="ansi32">planning because</span> to the extent planning does <span class="ansi32">work</span> it <span class="ansi31">[-does-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+doesn't+}</span> work by succeeding at that. <span class="ansi31">[-Next thing in Pory in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Like Singaporean+}</span> public <span class="ansi32">hospitals</span> don't <span class="ansi32">{+work+}</span> because they solve some computational problem. They seem to work because the people running <span class="ansi32">them</span> care about doing a good job and enough of the workers go along with that. <span class="ansi32">{+Yeah. So+}</span> related to that, I think in the meaning of <span class="ansi32">competition</span> he makes the point that the <span class="ansi32">{+most+}</span> interesting part of markets is when they go from one equilibrium to <span class="ansi32">another</span> because that's where they're trying to figure out what to produce and how to produce <span class="ansi31">[-a variance-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it better and so on,+}</span> and not the <span class="ansi31">[-equilibrium-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+equilibriums+}</span> themselves.

Well, it's always reason for <span class="ansi31">[-worry.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+worry, but+}</span> there's uncertainty about a lot of things and AI will help us with those other uncertainties. <span class="ansi32">{+So+}</span> on <span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that, do+}</span> you think more intelligence is likely to be good or bad, including against <span class="ansi31">[-x-risk.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+X risk?

So if it were the only risk, I'd be more worried <span class="ansi31">[-about---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about it+}</span> than if there's a <span class="ansi31">[-hom-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+whole+}</span> multitude of <span class="ansi32">risks but</span> clearly there's a <span class="ansi31">[-hom-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+whole+}</span> multitude of risks. But since <span class="ansi32">{+people+}</span> grew up in pretty stable <span class="ansi32">times they</span> tend not to see that in emotionally vivid terms. And then this one monster comes along and they're all terrified. <span class="ansi32">{+What would Hayek think of prediction+}</span> markets? Well, there were prediction markets in <span class="ansi31">[-high-ex-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Hayek's+}</span> time. I don't know that he wrote about <span class="ansi32">them</span> but I strongly suspect he would see them as markets that through <span class="ansi31">[-prices,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+prices communicate+}</span> information. But even <span class="ansi31">[-at-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+like around+}</span> the time of the Civil War, there were so-called bucket <span class="ansi32">shops</span> in the US and New York where you would bet on things. <span class="ansi31">[-There-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+They+}</span> were betting <span class="ansi31">[-markets.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+markets with+}</span> cash settlement, probably never called prediction markets, but they were exactly <span class="ansi32">that later</span> on, they were <span class="ansi31">[-band, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+banned. But+}</span> it's an <span class="ansi31">[-outstanding-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+old standing+}</span> thing. <span class="ansi31">[-They-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+There+}</span> were betting markets on <span class="ansi31">[-live.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+lives+}</span> in 17th century Britain, different attempts to outlaw them, which I think basically ended up <span class="ansi31">[-but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+succeeding. But+}</span> under the <span class="ansi32">table</span> I'm sure <span class="ansi31">[-it's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it+}</span> still went on to some extent. Yeah. <span class="ansi32">{+The reason it's interesting to+}</span> think about this is because his whole argument about the price system is that you can have a single dial that <span class="ansi31">[-because his whole argument about the price system is that you can have a single dial that information-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+aggregates so much information,+}</span> but it's precisely for this and <span class="ansi31">[-before-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+for+}</span> that reason it's so useful to somebody who's trying to <span class="ansi31">[-decide-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+decide, you know,+}</span> based on that information. But it's precisely for this reason that it's so <span class="ansi32">aggregated</span> that it's hard to learn about <span class="ansi31">[-it.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+any+}</span> one particular input to <span class="ansi32">that dial</span> But I would stress it's not a single <span class="ansi32">dial and</span> whether <span class="ansi32">{+Hayek+}</span> thought it was a single <span class="ansi32">dial</span> I think you can argue that either way. So people in <span class="ansi32">markets they</span> also observe <span class="ansi32">quantities they</span> observe reaction speeds. There's a lot of dimensions to <span class="ansi32">prices</span> other than just, oh, this newspaper cost $4, the terms on which it's advertised. So markets work so well because people are solving this complex <span class="ansi31">[-multi- dimensional problem and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+multidimensional problem.

Can you <span class="ansi31">[-play-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+apply+}</span> that argument in today's society against children and the way we treat them? <span class="ansi32">{+Yes, I think+}</span> we should treat children much better. We've made quite a few steps in that direction. <span class="ansi32">{+It's interesting to+}</span> think of <span class="ansi32">mills</span> argument as it relates to Hayek. So <span class="ansi31">[-Mills are you and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Mill is arguing+}</span> you can see more than just the local information. So keep in <span class="ansi32">mind</span> when <span class="ansi31">[-Milro,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Mill wrote,+}</span> every society that he knew <span class="ansi32">{+of,+}</span> at <span class="ansi32">least</span> treated women very poorly, oppressed women, women because they were physically <span class="ansi31">[-weak.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+weaker+}</span> or at a big disadvantage.

And <span class="ansi32">mills chief</span> argument is to say you're making a big <span class="ansi32">mistake if</span> you overly aggregate information from this one observation, that behind it is a lot of structure and a lot of the structure is <span class="ansi32">contingent and</span> that if <span class="ansi31">[-I and back-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I, Mill, unpack+}</span> the contingency for <span class="ansi32">you you</span> will see behind the signals.

Is it,+}</span> how big a deal is that? <span class="ansi32">{+The advice may get through+}</span> the cracks due to all the local statesmen who wisely advise their <span class="ansi32">representatives</span> in the house, right? So I don't know how much that <span class="ansi32">process</span> is better or worse compared to say the 1960s. I know plenty of smart people who think it's<span class="ansi31">[-are worse compared to say the 1960s. I know plenty of smart people who think it's-]</span> worse. <span class="ansi32">{+I'm+}</span> not convinced that's true. Let's talk about <span class="ansi32">{+Smith, Adam+}</span> Smith. Yeah. <span class="ansi31">[-Okay. One-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Okay, so one+}</span> of the things I find really remarkable about him is he, <span class="ansi31">[-he, he,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+so+}</span> he publishes in <span class="ansi31">[-1776 And-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+1776, the wealth of nations and+}</span> basically around that time, <span class="ansi31">[-given publishers,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Gibbon publishes+}</span> the decline <span class="ansi31">[-in the room in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+and fall of+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-environment. to publish-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Roman empire. Yep. So he publishes+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-client-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+decline and fall+}</span> of<span class="ansi31">[-all-]</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-room in a pirate.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Roman empire.+}</span> And one of his lines in there is, if you were <span class="ansi31">[-asked, a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+asked to+}</span> state <span class="ansi31">[-of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+a+}</span> period of time and man's condition was what is <span class="ansi31">[-best-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+his best,+}</span> it was <span class="ansi31">[-you know to read-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+during+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-rate-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+reign+}</span> of <span class="ansi32">{+Commodus to demission.+}</span> And <span class="ansi31">[-this-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that's+}</span> like 2000 years before that, right? So there's basically been, at least it's <span class="ansi31">[-like,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+like plausible+}</span> to somebody <span class="ansi32">{+who's+}</span> really <span class="ansi31">[-inspired-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+smart+}</span> that there's basically been no growth since for <span class="ansi32">2000</span> years. <span class="ansi32">{+And in+}</span> that context to be making the case of markets and mechanization and division of <span class="ansi32">labor</span> I think it's like even more <span class="ansi32">impressive</span> when you put it in the context <span class="ansi31">[-of, yes,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that he has+}</span> like basically been <span class="ansi31">[-seeing, you know,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+seeing+}</span> 0.5% or less growth. <span class="ansi31">[-you agree and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Strongly agree. And+}</span> this is in a way Smith being like <span class="ansi31">[-milk. Yes.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Mill. Yeah.+}</span> Smith is seeing the local <span class="ansi31">[-information of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+information, a+}</span> very small growth and the world barely being better than the Roman <span class="ansi31">[-Empire.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+empire and inferring+}</span> from that with increasing <span class="ansi32">returns</span> division of labor, how much is possible. So Smith is a bit more of a rationalist than Hayek makes him out to <span class="ansi31">[-be great.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+be. Right. Now,+}</span> I wonder if we use the same sort of <span class="ansi31">[-extrapolate-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+extrapolative+}</span> thinking<span class="ansi31">[-that's myth. use is-]</span> that <span class="ansi31">[-we-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Smith uses. We+}</span> haven't seen that much growth yet, but if you apply these sorts of principles, <span class="ansi32">{+this is what you would+}</span> expect to <span class="ansi32">see what</span> would <span class="ansi31">[-you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+he+}</span> make of the potential AI economy where <span class="ansi31">[-VC-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+we see+}</span> 2% <span class="ansi31">[-growth. you're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+growth a year+}</span> now, but you have billions of potential more agents or <span class="ansi31">[-something, what do you say it will-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+something. Would he say, well,+}</span> actually <span class="ansi31">[-be-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you might+}</span> have 10% growth because of this. <span class="ansi31">[-This-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Like this+}</span> is a, you would need more economic principles to explain this. <span class="ansi32">{+Or that+}</span> just adding that to our list of existing principles would imply big gains. <span class="ansi31">[-with-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+It's hard to say what+}</span> Smith would predict for AI. My suspicion is that the notion of 10% <span class="ansi31">[-growth. but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+growth was+}</span> simply not conceivable to him. So he wouldn't have predicted it because he never saw <span class="ansi32">anything</span> like <span class="ansi32">it that</span> to him, 3% growth would be a bit like 10% growth. <span class="ansi31">[-they were just chocking and and bold him over. But Smith...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+It would+}</span> just <span class="ansi31">[-chalk-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+shock+}</span> him and <span class="ansi31">[-bold-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bowl+}</span> him over. But Smith <span class="ansi31">[-does. like a size-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+does also emphasize+}</span> different human bottlenecks and constraints of the law. <span class="ansi32">{+So it's+}</span> quite possible Smith would see those <span class="ansi31">[-bottlenecs-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bottlenecks+}</span> as mattering and checking AI <span class="ansi31">[-growth.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+growth and its+}</span> speed. But as a principle, given the change we <span class="ansi31">[-saw, the pre-ness-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+saw pre pre-industrial+}</span> revolution <span class="ansi31">[-in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+and+}</span> after <span class="ansi31">[-1870. This-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+1870, does+}</span> to <span class="ansi32">you</span> it <span class="ansi31">[-seems possible-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+seem plausible+}</span> that you could go from the current regime to a regime where you have 10% <span class="ansi32">growth</span> for decades on <span class="ansi32">end</span> That does not seem plausible to me, but I would stress the <span class="ansi32">point</span> that high rates of growth <span class="ansi31">[-that cades-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+decades+}</span> on end, the <span class="ansi31">[-number ceased-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+numbers cease to exist. They cease+}</span> to have <span class="ansi32">meaning</span> because the numbers make the most sense when the economy is broadly similar. <span class="ansi31">[-Apple is in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Like, oh, everyone eats apples and+}</span> each <span class="ansi32">year</span> there's 10% more apples <span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+than a+}</span> roughly constant price. <span class="ansi32">{+As the basket changes,+}</span> the numbers become meaningless. It's not to deny there's a lot of <span class="ansi32">growth but</span> you can think about it better by discarding the <span class="ansi32">number and</span> presumably<span class="ansi31">[-the-]</span> AI will <span class="ansi31">[-change.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+change the+}</span> composition of various bundles quite a bit over time. So when you hear these estimates about <span class="ansi32">what</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-GD people were happy that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+GDP per capita+}</span> was in the Roman <span class="ansi32">empire</span> do you just disregard that <span class="ansi32">{+and think,+}</span> in terms of qualitative changes from that time? <span class="ansi32">depends</span> what they're being compared to. So there's pieces <span class="ansi31">[-and economics. a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in economic+}</span> history that are looking <span class="ansi32">at say 17th</span> 18th century <span class="ansi32">europe</span> comparing it to the Roman <span class="ansi31">[-Empire, most to GDP's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+empire. Most of GDP is+}</span> agriculture, which is pretty comparable, right? <span class="ansi32">especially</span> in Europe. It's not wheat versus corn. It's wheat and wheat. <span class="ansi32">{+And+}</span> I've seen estimates <span class="ansi31">[-that all-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that, oh,+}</span> say by 1730, some parts of Western Europe are <span class="ansi31">[-clear.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+clearly+}</span> better off than the Roman <span class="ansi32">empire</span> at its peak. But like within range, those are the best <span class="ansi31">[-to me it's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+estimates+}</span> I <span class="ansi32">know and</span> I trust <span class="ansi32">those theyre</span> not <span class="ansi32">perfect but</span> I don't think there's an index number <span class="ansi31">[-problem. them-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+problem+}</span> so much. And so when people say we're 50% richer <span class="ansi32">than</span> an average <span class="ansi31">[-room-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Roman+}</span> at the peak of the <span class="ansi31">[-Empire. But-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+empire,+}</span> this kind of <span class="ansi31">[-thinking... and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+thinking doesn't+}</span> make sense to you. It doesn't make sense to me. And a simple way to show that, let's say you could buy from <span class="ansi31">[-the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+a+}</span> Sears <span class="ansi32">robot</span> catalog of today or from 1905 and you have <span class="ansi31">[-50 the Sears Robot Catalog of today or from 1905.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+$50,000+}</span> to <span class="ansi32">spend which</span> catalog would you rather buy from? <span class="ansi32">{+You have to think+}</span> about <span class="ansi31">[-it. Now-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it, right? Now,+}</span> if you just look at changes in the CPI, it should be obvious <span class="ansi31">[-you'd-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you would+}</span> prefer the catalog from 1905. Everything's so much cheaper. That <span class="ansi32">{+white shirt costs+}</span> almost nothing. Right. At the same time, you don't want that stuff. It's not mostly part <span class="ansi32">{+of+}</span> the modern bundle. So even if you ended up <span class="ansi31">[-referring-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+preferring+}</span> the earlier catalog, the fact that you have to think about it reflects the ambiguities. <span class="ansi32">{+Mm.+}</span> When you read <span class="ansi31">[-that contemporary---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the contemporaries+}</span> of Smith, other economists <span class="ansi32">{+who+}</span> were writing at the time, <span class="ansi31">[-where-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+were+}</span> his arguments<span class="ansi31">[-It's-]</span> just <span class="ansi31">[-clearly-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+clearly,+}</span> given the evidence of the <span class="ansi32">time</span> much better than everybody <span class="ansi31">[-around. It-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+around? Or+}</span> was <span class="ansi32">{+it+}</span> just that <span class="ansi31">[-expo is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ex post, he was+}</span> clearly right, but given the arguments of the time, it could have gone <span class="ansi32">{+any one of different+}</span> ways. Well, there aren't that many economists at the time <span class="ansi31">[-is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of+}</span> Smith, so it depends what <span class="ansi31">[-you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you're+}</span> counting. I <span class="ansi32">mean</span> the two <span class="ansi31">[-fellows, COTS,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+fellow Scots+}</span> you could compare Smith <span class="ansi31">[-too, or-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+to are+}</span> Sir James <span class="ansi31">[-Stewart.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Stuart,+}</span> who published a major work, I <span class="ansi32">think</span> in <span class="ansi32">1767 on</span> some <span class="ansi31">[-matters. Stewart was ahead of Smith, not most. Clearly Smith-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+matters, Stuart+}</span> was <span class="ansi31">[-far greater,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ahead,+}</span> but <span class="ansi31">[-Stewart-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+he+}</span> was <span class="ansi31">[-no and the other point of comparison is David Hume, Smith's best friend, of course. Per page you could argue Hume is better than Smith. Certainly on monetary theory Hume is better. Smith. Now he's not a goat contender. He just didn't do enough.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So then something that we like Carl Wdefense.+}</span> But <span class="ansi32">{+when+}</span> I <span class="ansi31">[-wouldn't say Smith was ahead of Hume. He had-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+look at opinions that are+}</span> more <span class="ansi32">{+than just what has bet on the political record, right, everybody has one sort of positive mentality+}</span> and <span class="ansi31">[-more important things. but hum is pretty impressive. Now if you're talking about, oh like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+they have+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-eight century-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wrong view, and they have a negative mindset. Is David you have an argument you don't have to be+}</span> German camera lists. Well, they were bad <span class="ansi31">[-mercantil---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+mercantilists.+}</span> But there's <span class="ansi32">people say</span> writing in Sweden in the <span class="ansi32">1760s</span> analyzing exchange <span class="ansi32">rates</span> who had better understandings of exchange rates than Smith ever did. So it's not that <span class="ansi32">{+he+}</span> just dominated everyone. Let me offer some other <span class="ansi32">potential</span> nominees that were not in the <span class="ansi31">[-book. Sure,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+book+}</span> for <span class="ansi31">[-goat-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Goethe,+}</span> and I want your opinions<span class="ansi31">[-up them. In terms-]</span> of <span class="ansi31">[-explaining how land is fundamentally different from labor and capital when we're thinking.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+them. Henry George,+}</span> in terms of explaining how land is fundamentally different from labor and capital when we're thinking <span class="ansi31">[-about. Well first-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about the economy. Well, first,+}</span> I'm not sure land is that fundamentally different from labor and capital. <span class="ansi32">{+A lot of the+}</span> value of land comes from <span class="ansi32">improvements and</span> much of <span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> improvement can be quite subtle. <span class="ansi32">{+It+}</span> doesn't just have to be, you know, putting a plow to the land. So I would put <span class="ansi31">[-your...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+George+}</span> in the top 25, <span class="ansi32">{+a+}</span> very important <span class="ansi32">thinker but</span> he's a bit of <span class="ansi32">a not</span> a <span class="ansi31">[-one note,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+one-note+}</span> Johnny.

He's worth reading very <span class="ansi32">carefully a</span> few years <span class="ansi32">ago were</span> recording here at Mercatus. We had <span class="ansi31">[-a 12 person two day-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+a, like, 12-person, two-day+}</span> session <span class="ansi32">with</span> Peter Thiel just on reading Henry George. It's all we did. <span class="ansi32">{+And people came away+}</span> very <span class="ansi32">impressed</span> I think. <span class="ansi31">[-I'm informed you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+And for people who+}</span> are <span class="ansi32">interested</span> they might enjoy the episode I did with Lars <span class="ansi31">[-that uh... who oh i-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Doucette, who... Oh, I+}</span> don't know about <span class="ansi32">this hes</span> a <span class="ansi31">[-georgist oh yeah he's uh...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Georgist? Oh, yeah.+}</span> He's a really smart guy. He <span class="ansi32">wrote basically</span> he wrote a book review of <span class="ansi32">{+Henry George+}</span> that <span class="ansi31">[-once caught-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+won Scott+}</span> Alexander's book review contest. Oh, I <span class="ansi31">[-end with this.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+knew what this was.+}</span> And then he <span class="ansi31">[-says-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+just+}</span> turned <span class="ansi32">{+it+}</span> into a whole <span class="ansi31">[-book. come-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+book of+}</span> his own, which is actually really good. And I think <span class="ansi31">[-through-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+there's+}</span> something truly humane <span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in George+}</span> when you read <span class="ansi32">him</span> that can be a bit <span class="ansi32">infectious</span> that's positive. <span class="ansi32">{+Mm-hmm.+}</span> And <span class="ansi31">[-there-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it's something...

Well, even though I think the 1937 piece is wrong, it did create one of the most important genres. He gets a lot of credit for that. He gets a lot of credit for the <span class="ansi31">[-coast-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Coase+}</span> theorem. <span class="ansi32">{+The+}</span> FCC property rights piece is superb. The <span class="ansi31">[-light has pieces-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+lighthouse piece is+}</span> very good. <span class="ansi32">{+Again, he's+}</span> in the top 25.

He is a top-tier <span class="ansi31">[-node.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Nobel laureate,+}</span> but I don't think he's a serious contender for greatest <span class="ansi31">[-economists-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+economist+}</span> of all time. He gets the most credit for making <span class="ansi31">[-game-seary,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+game theory+}</span> intuitive, <span class="ansi32">{+empirical, and workable,+}</span> and<span class="ansi31">[-And-]</span> that's worth a lot.

So I think I underrated <span class="ansi31">[-that I would be-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Arrow a bit+}</span> in the <span class="ansi32">book if</span> you <span class="ansi31">[-ask.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ask, like,+}</span> what regrets do I have about the book? I say <span class="ansi32">very</span> very nice things about <span class="ansi31">[-his push to me-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Arrow, but I think I should have pushed it away. I should have pushed him+}</span> even more. What would <span class="ansi31">[-he arrest him for the action-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Arrow say about prediction+}</span> markets? <span class="ansi32">well</span> he was really the <span class="ansi32">pioneer</span> of theoretically understanding how they work. <span class="ansi31">[-So, He-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Yeah. So he+}</span> was around until quite recently. I'm sure he had things to say about prediction <span class="ansi32">markets probably</span> positive. <span class="ansi31">[-One-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Hmm. So one+}</span> of the points you <span class="ansi31">[-make---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+make in+}</span> the book is economics at the time was really a way of carrying forward big ideas about the world. What discipline today is where that happens? Well, internet <span class="ansi32">writing its</span> not a discipline. <span class="ansi32">{+It's a discipline.+}</span> But it's a <span class="ansi32">sphere</span> and plenty of it happens more than ever <span class="ansi32">before but</span> it's <span class="ansi31">[-irrigated-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+segregated+}</span> from what counts as original theorizing in the academic sense of that word. Is that a good or bad segregation? I'm not sure. But it's really a very <span class="ansi32">sharp</span> radical break from how things <span class="ansi31">[-have-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+had+}</span> been. And it's why I don't think there'll be a new <span class="ansi32">{+goat contender.+}</span> Probably not <span class="ansi32">ever or</span> if there <span class="ansi32">is</span> it will be something AI related. <span class="ansi32">{+Hmm.+}</span> That sounds about right to me. But within the context of internet writing, <span class="ansi32">obviously</span> there's <span class="ansi31">[-there economics being a prominent one.

Somehow I feel+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-audience the discipline-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+disciplines+}</span> cease <span class="ansi32">to matter that</span> really good internet writing is <span class="ansi32">multidisciplinary when</span> I meet someone like a Scott <span class="ansi32">aronson</span> who's doing like computer <span class="ansi32">science</span> AI type internet writing on <span class="ansi31">[-this blog.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+his blog,+}</span> I have way more in <span class="ansi32">{+common+}</span> with <span class="ansi31">[-him, then-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+him than+}</span> with a typical research <span class="ansi31">[-economist, say it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+economist.

And it's not because I know enough <span class="ansi31">[-of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about+}</span> computer <span class="ansi32">science like</span> I may or may <span class="ansi31">[-not. is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+not know a+}</span> certain <span class="ansi32">amount but</span> it's because our two enterprises are so <span class="ansi32">similar or</span> Scott <span class="ansi32">alexander he</span> writes about mental illness also. That just feels so similar. And we really have to rethink what the disciplines are. It may be that method of writing is the <span class="ansi32">key</span> differentiator for this particular sphere. <span class="ansi31">[-Yeah, it's got-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Yeah. Not for+}</span> everything. <span class="ansi32">{+Scott Aronson was my professor in+}</span> college. <span class="ansi31">[-Yeah,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Oh,+}</span> that's <span class="ansi32">{+great.

Because you-]</span> see <span class="ansi32">{+like+}</span> two standard deviations above you easily. You know, you might as well <span class="ansi32">{+just+}</span> choose a different game. But his method of thinking and <span class="ansi31">[-writing.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+writing+}</span> is <span class="ansi32">infectious like</span> that <span class="ansi31">[-is gone as an under any-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of Scott Alexander and many+}</span> of the rest of us. <span class="ansi32">{+Yeah.

And it's not <span class="ansi31">[-Recognized-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+sufficiently recognized+}</span> as something like a new field or <span class="ansi32">discipline but</span> that's what it is. I wonder <span class="ansi32">{+if+}</span> you're doing enough of that when it comes to <span class="ansi32">ai where</span> I think you have really interesting thoughts about <span class="ansi31">[-GPD file level stuff but this has-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+GPT-5.

If you just <span class="ansi31">[-like, it's These-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+extrapolate out these+}</span> trends, I feel like you might have a lot of interesting thoughts about when you <span class="ansi32">think</span> just in terms of what might be possible <span class="ansi32">with</span> something much further down the line. <span class="ansi32">well</span> I have a whole book with AI <span class="ansi31">[-predictions averages-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+predictions.

Yeah.+}</span> I'll come close to saying yes. <span class="ansi32">{+First, we tax+}</span> savings right now. So we should stop taxing savings. Absolutely. I think it's hard to come up with workable ways of subsidizing savings that don't give <span class="ansi31">[-people,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+rich people+}</span> a lot of free stuff in a way that's politically unacceptable and also unfair. So I'm not sure we have a good way of subsidizing <span class="ansi32">savings but</span> in <span class="ansi32">principle</span> I would <span class="ansi31">[-before-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+be for+}</span> it if we could do it in the proper targeted <span class="ansi31">[-matter. --]</span><span class="ansi32">{+manner.+}</span> Although you had a good argument <span class="ansi32">against</span> this in <span class="ansi32">stubborn attachments right that</span> over the long term, if economic growth is high <span class="ansi32">enough then</span> the savings of the <span class="ansi31">[-Red Bull would-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+rich will+}</span> just be dissipated to everybody below. Well, I'm not sure <span class="ansi31">[-if-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+to+}</span> whom it's <span class="ansi32">dissipated it</span> does get dissipated. The great fortunes of the past <span class="ansi31">[-I'm not sure if whom it's dissipated it does get dissipated the great fortunes of the past-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+are mostly gone.+}</span> But they may not go to people <span class="ansi32">below and</span> the idea of writing <span class="ansi31">[-to attack-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+into a tax+}</span> system subsidies on that scale,<span class="ansi31">[-and that's-]</span> in <span class="ansi32">{+essence,+}</span> subsidies to <span class="ansi31">[-wealth.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wealth,+}</span> not GDP, but wealth is, say, six to eight times GDP. <span class="ansi32">{+I just think the practical+}</span> problems are quite significant. It's not an idea <span class="ansi31">[-of pushing, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I'm pushing. But+}</span> there may <span class="ansi32">{+at margins+}</span> be<span class="ansi31">[-more-]</span> ways you can do <span class="ansi31">[-it, that say-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it that, say,+}</span> only benefit people who are poor. <span class="ansi32">ways</span> you can <span class="ansi31">[-improve-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+improve, like+}</span> the workings of local credit unions through better <span class="ansi32">{+either regulation,+}</span> deregulation, <span class="ansi31">[-better-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that are a+}</span> kind of de facto subsidy without having to <span class="ansi32">subsidize</span> all of the saved wealth. There's got to be a lot of ways you can do <span class="ansi32">that and</span> we should look for that more. Relatedly, I think a couple <span class="ansi32">{+of+}</span> years ago, Paul Schleming had an interesting <span class="ansi32">{+paper. He wrote a book called The Greatest Taxes in the World. It's a great book. It's a great+}</span> paper that if you look from <span class="ansi31">[-13 11-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+1311+}</span> to <span class="ansi32">now</span> interest rates have been declining. There's been hundreds of <span class="ansi32">years</span> of interest rate declines. What is the big picture explanation of this trend? I'm not sure we have one. You may know Cowan's <span class="ansi32">third law all</span> propositions <span class="ansi31">[-of how-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+about+}</span> real interest rates are wrong. But simply lower risk, better information, higher buffers of <span class="ansi31">[-wealth.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+wealth would+}</span> be what you'd call the intuitive, <span class="ansi31">[-economic-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+economistic+}</span> explanations. There's probably something <span class="ansi32">to them but</span> how much <span class="ansi31">[-do-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of+}</span> that trend do they actually <span class="ansi31">[-explain is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+explain? Is it+}</span> like a percent of the <span class="ansi32">variance</span> I don't know. Let's talk about anarchy. <span class="ansi31">[-You have P.V. First-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Anarchy, yes. You've heard papers+}</span> about <span class="ansi31">[-this ad.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+this. I hadn't read+}</span> the last time we <span class="ansi32">talked and</span> they're really interesting. So maybe you can <span class="ansi31">[-re-say-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+restate your+}</span> arguments as you answer this question. But how much of your arguments about how network industries lead to these cartel-like <span class="ansi32">dynamics how</span> much of that can help explain what happened to social <span class="ansi32">media web 20</span> I don't view that as such a cartel. I think there's a <span class="ansi32">{+cartel+}</span> at one <span class="ansi32">level</span> which is <span class="ansi32">small but</span> significant. This is maybe more true three, four years ago than today with <span class="ansi31">[-the Alano and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Elon owning+}</span> Twitter and other changes. <span class="ansi32">{+But if someone got kicked+}</span> off social media <span class="ansi32">platforms three</span> four years ago, they would tend to get kicked <span class="ansi32">off</span> all or most of them. It wasn't like a consciously collusive decision. <span class="ansi31">[-It wasn't like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+But it's+}</span> a <span class="ansi31">[-consciously collusive decision. like oh well-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bit like, oh,+}</span> I know the guy who runs that platform and he's pretty <span class="ansi32">smart and</span> if he's <span class="ansi31">[-worried-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+worried, I+}</span> should be <span class="ansi32">worried and</span> that was very bad. I don't think it was <span class="ansi32">{+otherwise. I think it was a little bit more of a, oh, I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I don't think it was+}</span> otherwise such a collusive <span class="ansi32">equilibrium maybe</span> some dimensions on <span class="ansi31">[-hiring.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+hiring social+}</span> people, software <span class="ansi32">engineers there</span> was some collusion, not <span class="ansi31">[-a of bidding, but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+enough bidding. But+}</span> it was mostly competing for attention. So I think the real <span class="ansi32">risk</span> protection agencies <span class="ansi32">aside</span> of network-based <span class="ansi31">[-pollution-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+collusion+}</span> is through banking systems where you have clearinghouses and payments <span class="ansi32">networks and</span> to be part of <span class="ansi32">{+it,+}</span> the clearinghouse <span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in+}</span> the absence of legal constraint can indeed <span class="ansi31">[-everyone, include and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+be a risk. And+}</span> if you don't go along with the collusion, you're kicked out of the payment system. That strikes me as a real issue. Do your arguments against <span class="ansi31">[-and our... Do-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+anarchy, do+}</span> they apply <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+at+}</span> all to <span class="ansi31">[-web 3.0, crypto like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Web 3.0 crypto-like+}</span> stuff? Do I think it will evolve into collusion? I don't see why it would. I'm open to <span class="ansi31">[-here.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+hearing+}</span> the argument that it <span class="ansi32">could though what</span> would that argument go like? <span class="ansi32">well</span> I guess we did see <span class="ansi32">{+with+}</span> crypto that you <span class="ansi32">{+have, you know, you+}</span> have <span class="ansi32">{+a lot of people who are interested+}</span> in <span class="ansi32">{+crypto. And I think that's a good argument. In+}</span> order to just have workable <span class="ansi32">settlement</span> you need<span class="ansi31">[-at-]</span> these centralized <span class="ansi31">[-institutions and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+institutions. And+}</span> from <span class="ansi32">there</span> you can get kicked off <span class="ansi31">[-those.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+those, and+}</span> the government is involved with those. <span class="ansi31">[-You-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+And you+}</span> can maybe abstract the government <span class="ansi31">[-away-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+out+}</span> and say<span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span> they will need to <span class="ansi32">{+collude+}</span> in some sense in order to facilitate transactions. And the exchanges have ended up quite <span class="ansi31">[-centralized. - Yeah, and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+centralized, right? Yeah. And+}</span> that's an example of<span class="ansi31">[-it,-]</span> clearing <span class="ansi31">[-out this in exchange is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+houses and exchanges being+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-vulnerability. but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+vulnerable node. But+}</span> I don't know how much Web 3.0 is ever going to rely on that. <span class="ansi32">{+It seems+}</span> you can create new <span class="ansi32">{+confidentiallk, too, for that matter. I've seen that, yes. create new+}</span> crypto <span class="ansi32">assets</span> more or less it <span class="ansi32">will theres</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-locality-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+focality+}</span> of getting them started. But if there's a real problem with the <span class="ansi31">[-preexisting crease.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+pre-existing crypto assets,+}</span> I would think you could overcome that. So I would expect something more like a <span class="ansi31">[-two in Frou.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+to and fro,+}</span> waves of <span class="ansi32">centralization decentralization</span> and natural checks embedded in the system. That's my <span class="ansi32">intuition</span> at least. Does your argument against anarchy prove too much in the sense that <span class="ansi31">[-That's my intuition at least. - Does your argument against anarchy prove too much, in the sense that globally? for-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+globally, different+}</span> nations <span class="ansi31">[-and in our calculations of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+have anarchic relations with+}</span> each <span class="ansi32">other</span> and they can't <span class="ansi31">[-they can't for us course and monopolize-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+enforce coercive monopoly on+}</span> each other, but they can coordinate to punish <span class="ansi31">[-matters-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bad+}</span> actors in the way <span class="ansi31">[-we'll do on-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you would want+}</span> protection agencies <span class="ansi31">[-today. right, like, be in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+to do, right? Like we can+}</span> sanction <span class="ansi31">[-or career-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+North Korea+}</span> together or something. I think that's a very good point and very good question. But I would rephrase my argument. You could say it's my argument against <span class="ansi31">[-anarchy.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+anarchy, and+}</span> it is an argument against <span class="ansi32">anarchy but</span> it's also an argument that <span class="ansi31">[-says, "I enter keys everywhere." Well,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+says anarchy is everywhere. So within government, well, the feds,+}</span> the state <span class="ansi31">[-government saw-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+governments, all+}</span> the different layers of federalism. <span class="ansi32">{+This is a very good question. There's a kind of anarchy.+}</span> There's not quite a final layer of adjudication, the way you might <span class="ansi31">[-think we participate.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+think. We pretend there is.+}</span> I'm not sure how strong it is. Internationally, of <span class="ansi32">course you know</span> how much gets enforced by <span class="ansi32">hegemon</span> how much is spontaneous <span class="ansi32">order even</span> the different parts of the federal <span class="ansi31">[-government. We're going to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+government, they're in a+}</span> kind of anarchy with respect to each other. So you need a fair degree of collusion for things to <span class="ansi32">work</span> and you <span class="ansi31">[-want-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ought+}</span> to accept <span class="ansi32">that but</span> maybe in a <span class="ansi31">[-strive scene-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Straussian+}</span> way where you don't trumpet it too <span class="ansi32">loudly</span> But the point that anarchy itself will evolve enough collusion to enable it to persist, if it persists at all, is my central point. My point is like, well, anarchy isn't that different. Now, given we've put a <span class="ansi32">lot</span> of social political capital into our current <span class="ansi32">institutions</span> I don't <span class="ansi32">{+see+}</span> why you would press the anarchy button. But if I'm North <span class="ansi32">korea</span> and I can press the anarchy <span class="ansi31">[-button. and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+button+}</span> for North Korea, I get that it might just evolve <span class="ansi31">[-into Haiti.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+into, you know, a new kind of a new kind of a new kind of anarchy.+}</span> But I probably would press the anarchy button for North <span class="ansi32">korea</span> if at least someone would come in and control the <span class="ansi31">[-- This-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+loose nukes. Yeah, this+}</span> is related to one of those classic arguments <span class="ansi31">[-in the gonna stay on our key-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+against anarchy+}</span> that <span class="ansi31">[-Andrea and I can do anything.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+under anarchy anything is allowed.+}</span> So the government is allowed. <span class="ansi32">therefore</span> we're in a state of anarchy in some sense. <span class="ansi31">[-We have-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+In+}</span> a funny <span class="ansi32">way</span> that <span class="ansi32">arguments</span> correct.

My worry is that energy becomes too <span class="ansi32">cheap</span> and people at very low cost can destroy things rather easily. <span class="ansi32">{+So say+}</span> if a <span class="ansi31">[-nuclear is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+nuclear, if+}</span> destroying a city with a nuclear weapon cost <span class="ansi32">50000 what</span> would the world look like? I'm just not <span class="ansi32">sure it</span> might be more <span class="ansi31">[-stable. and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+stable than+}</span> we think, but I'm greatly <span class="ansi32">worried</span> and I could readily imagine it falling apart. <span class="ansi32">{+Yeah.+}</span> But I guess the bigger point <span class="ansi31">[-of-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+I'm+}</span> making is <span class="ansi32">that</span> in this case, the <span class="ansi32">{+reason, for the reason that I'm saying, is that the reason that we're talking about is that the world is a very, very small country. And we have a lot of people in the world who don't know, and they're not really interested in the world. And so I'm just asking, is that the+}</span> reason <span class="ansi32">{+that+}</span> the nuclear <span class="ansi32">{+got+}</span> so <span class="ansi31">[-she-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+cheap+}</span> was because of <span class="ansi32">intelligence now</span> that doesn't mean we should stop <span class="ansi31">[-intelligence. But-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+intelligence, but just that+}</span> if that's like the end result of intelligence over hundreds of years, that doesn't seem <span class="ansi31">[-like... and tell him, "This-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+like intelligence+}</span> is always a <span class="ansi31">[-neck good." --]</span><span class="ansi32">{+net good.+}</span> Well, we're doing better than the other great <span class="ansi31">[-a---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+apes,+}</span> I would say, even though we <span class="ansi31">[-faced-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+face+}</span> these really big risks. And in the meantime, we did incredible <span class="ansi32">{+things.+}</span> So that's a gamble I would take. But I believe we should view it more self-consciously as a sort<span class="ansi31">[-of...-]</span> of <span class="ansi31">[-gamble-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+gamble,+}</span> and it's too late to turn back. The fundamental choice was one of <span class="ansi31">[-these and that may have happened hundreds of millions or billions of years ago.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+decentralization.+}</span> And that may have happened hundreds of millions or billions of years ago. <span class="ansi31">[-and talk-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+And once you opt+}</span> for <span class="ansi32">decentralization intelligence</span> is going to have <span class="ansi31">[-advantages. You're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+advantages, and you're+}</span> not going to be able to turn the clock back on it. So you're walking this <span class="ansi31">[-tight rope and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+tightrope. And+}</span> by <span class="ansi32">goodness</span> you'd<span class="ansi31">[-be...-]</span> better do a good job. I <span class="ansi31">[-mean-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+mean,+}</span> we should <span class="ansi31">[-train-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+frame+}</span> our broader history more like that. And it has implications for how you think about X-risk. Again, I think <span class="ansi31">[-if-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of+}</span> the <span class="ansi32">xrisk</span> people, a <span class="ansi31">[-bit-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+bit of them, it's like, well, we're going to have a lot+}</span> of <span class="ansi31">[-them it's like well-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+trouble.+}</span> I've been living in Berkeley a long <span class="ansi32">time</span> and it's<span class="ansi31">[-it's-]</span> really not that <span class="ansi31">[-different my-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+different. My+}</span> life's a bit <span class="ansi32">better and</span> we can't risk all of this. But that's not how you should view broader history. I feel like you're an <span class="ansi31">[-extra-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+X-risk+}</span> person.<span class="ansi31">[-You have a-]</span> I mean, even they don't think we're<span class="ansi31">[-like-]</span> 100% guaranteed to go out by 800 years or something. <span class="ansi32">{+They have some probable- No, I don't think we're+}</span> guaranteed <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+at+}</span> all. It's up to us. I just think the risk, not that everyone <span class="ansi32">dies</span> I think that's quite low, but that we retreat to some kind of pretty chaotic form of<span class="ansi31">[-like-]</span> medieval <span class="ansi31">[-Balkan's existence with-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Balkans existence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's probably the default setting. With+}</span> a much lower population.

With+}</span> or without <span class="ansi31">[-AI is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+AI, it's+}</span> probably the default setting. Given that you think <span class="ansi31">[-that's the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of that as a+}</span> default setting, why is that <span class="ansi32">not</span> a big part of <span class="ansi31">[-your, what-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+when+}</span> you're thinking <span class="ansi32">about</span> how new technologies are coming <span class="ansi32">about</span> Why not consciously think in terms <span class="ansi32">of</span> is this getting us <span class="ansi31">[-with-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+to+}</span> the outcome where <span class="ansi31">[-you-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+we+}</span> avoid this <span class="ansi31">[-sort of a free industrial-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+pre-industrial+}</span> state that would result from the $50,000 <span class="ansi31">[-news.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+nukes? Well, if you+}</span> think the risk is <span class="ansi32">{+changing. The risk is+}</span> cheap energy more than AI per <span class="ansi31">[-say.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+se.+}</span> Admittedly, AI could speed the <span class="ansi31">[-pattern.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+path to+}</span> cheap energy. It seems very hard to <span class="ansi32">control the strategy</span> that's worked best so far is to have relatively benevolent nations become <span class="ansi31">[-hegemon.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+hegemons+}</span> and <span class="ansi31">[-established-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+establish+}</span> dominance. So it does influence me. I want the US, UK, some other <span class="ansi31">[-subsets-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+subset+}</span> of nations to establish dominance in AI. <span class="ansi32">it</span> may not work forever, but in a decentralized world, it sure beats the alternative. So a lot of the AI types, they're <span class="ansi31">[-two rationalists,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+too rationalist,+}</span> and they don't start with the premise that we chose<span class="ansi31">[-centralized world-]</span> a <span class="ansi31">[-very very long time ago even way before humans.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+decentralized+}</span> world a <span class="ansi32">very</span> very long time <span class="ansi32">ago</span> even way before humans. <span class="ansi32">{+And I think you made an interesting+}</span> point when you were talking about Keynes in the book where <span class="ansi31">[-he-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+you+}</span> said one of his faults was that he <span class="ansi32">{+assumed+}</span> that people like him would always be in charge.<span class="ansi31">[---]</span> That's right.<span class="ansi31">[---]</span> And I do see that also in the alignment discourse. <span class="ansi32">{+Like alignment is, you know, if it's just handing over the government and just assuming the government does what you'd expect it to do.+}</span> And I worry about<span class="ansi31">[-that.-]</span> this <span class="ansi31">[-for-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+from+}</span> my own point of view. So even if you think US is pretty benevolent today, which is a <span class="ansi32">highly</span> contested and mixed <span class="ansi31">[-proposition.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+proposition, and+}</span> I'm an American citizen, pretty patriotic, but I'm fully aware of the long history of my government <span class="ansi31">[-and killing and slaving-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in killing, enslaving,+}</span> doing other terrible <span class="ansi32">things</span> to <span class="ansi32">people and</span> then you have to rethink that over a long period of <span class="ansi31">[-time.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+time, it may be the worst+}</span> time period that affects the final <span class="ansi32">outcome even</span> if the <span class="ansi31">[-average. just-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+average is+}</span> pretty <span class="ansi32">good and</span> then if power corrupts and if government even indirectly controls AI <span class="ansi32">systems</span> so US government could become <span class="ansi31">[-worse because it's a leader right?-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+more, more powerful than the US government. And that's the problem. And that's the problem. And that's the problem. And that's the problem.+}</span> But <span class="ansi32">again</span> I've got to still take that over China or <span class="ansi32">russia</span> or wherever else it might be. I just don't really understand when people talk about national <span class="ansi32">security</span> I've never seen the AI <span class="ansi31">[-do-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+doomers+}</span> say anything that made sense.

What's your sense? I think our national security people are <span class="ansi32">{+among,+}</span> amongst the smartest people in our government. They're mostly well-intentioned in a good way. They're paying careful attention to <span class="ansi31">[-anything.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+many things.+}</span> But what will be the political will to do what they don't control? And my guess is until there's <span class="ansi31">[-through-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+sort of+}</span> an <span class="ansi31">[-SPF like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+SBF-like+}</span> incident, which might even not be significant, but a headlines incident, which <span class="ansi31">[-SPF-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+SBF+}</span> was, even if it doesn't affect the <span class="ansi31">[-revolution-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+future evolution+}</span> of crypto, which I guess is my <span class="ansi31">[-view.

And then we'll have an <span class="ansi31">[-SPF like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+SBF-like+}</span> incident and we'll overreact. <span class="ansi32">{+That+}</span> seems a very common pattern in American history. And the fact that it's AI, the stakes might be <span class="ansi31">[-higher, whatever,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+high or whatever.+}</span> I doubt if it will change the recurrence of that pattern. How would Robert <span class="ansi31">[-know that I-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Nozick+}</span> think about different <span class="ansi31">[-AIU topials?-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+AI utopias? Well,+}</span> I think he did think about different AI <span class="ansi31">[-Utopius,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+utopias,+}</span> right? <span class="ansi32">{+So+}</span> I believe he, whether he wrote or talked about it, but the notion of humans <span class="ansi31">[-might-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+much+}</span> smarter than <span class="ansi31">[-they are,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+they,+}</span> or the notion of aliens coming down who are like <span class="ansi31">[-something so-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in some+}</span> way <span class="ansi32">morally</span> intellectually way beyond us. He did write about that and he was worried about <span class="ansi32">{+how+}</span> they would treat us. So he was sensitive to what you would call AI risk <span class="ansi31">[-for you to be-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+viewed a bit+}</span> more <span class="ansi32">{+broadly,+}</span> very early on. What was his take? <span class="ansi31">[-because-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Well, Nozick is+}</span> not a thinker of takes. <span class="ansi31">[-And I think our-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+He was a thinker of+}</span> speculations <span class="ansi31">[-in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+and+}</span> multiple <span class="ansi31">[-parts. possibilities.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+possibilities, which+}</span> I liked about him.

Wait, that made <span class="ansi31">[-him, oh,-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+him a vegetarian?

At least he felt he should be. I wonder if we should honor past generations <span class="ansi32">more</span> or at least <span class="ansi31">[-I-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+like+}</span> respect their wishes more <span class="ansi32">for</span> if we think of the <span class="ansi31">[-problem is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+alignment problem, it's+}</span> similar to how we react to our previous generations. Do we want the <span class="ansi31">[-ice treatises-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+AI to treat us as+}</span> we treat people thousands of years ago? <span class="ansi32">{+Yeah, it's a+}</span> good <span class="ansi32">question and</span> I've never met anyone who's consistent with how they view wishes of the dead. I don't think there is a <span class="ansi32">consistent</span> philosophically grounded point of <span class="ansi31">[-I'm-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+view on+}</span> that one.

But this <span class="ansi31">[-raised-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+raises+}</span> the question of why is <span class="ansi31">[-it-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> dollar <span class="ansi31">[-sustainable?-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+so stable?+}</span> So we're also democracy, right? But like the <span class="ansi32">dollar</span> seems pretty well managed. What is the larger explanation of <span class="ansi31">[-why? The-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+why+}</span> monetary <span class="ansi31">[-policy-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+policies+}</span> seems well managed in the <span class="ansi32">us</span> Well,<span class="ansi31">[-the-]</span> US voters hate <span class="ansi31">[-inflation.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+inflation,+}</span> mostly for good <span class="ansi32">reasons and</span> we have enough wealth that we can pay our <span class="ansi32">bills</span> without having to inflate very much. And 2% has been stable now for quite a while. Now it's an interesting <span class="ansi32">question</span> which I cannot <span class="ansi32">answer and</span> I have looked into this and I have asked <span class="ansi32">{+smart people from+}</span> Argentina. Why does Argentina in particular have recurring waves of <span class="ansi31">[-inflation.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+hyperinflation?+}</span> Is there something about the structure of their interest groups that <span class="ansi32">inevitably</span> recurringly leads them to demand too <span class="ansi32">much</span> I suppose. But there's plenty of poor badly run countries that don't have hyperinflation. African countries historically have not had high rates of hyperinflation, haven't had high rates of inflation. Why is that? Well, maybe they don't capture enough through senior age for some reason. <span class="ansi32">currency</span> holdings aren't large <span class="ansi31">[-enough to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+enough. There's+}</span> some kind of financial repression. I don't know. But it's very hard to explain why some of these countries but not others go crazy with the <span class="ansi31">[-&gt;&gt; This-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+printing press. And this+}</span> is maybe a broader question <span class="ansi32">about</span> different institutions in the <span class="ansi32">government</span> where I don't understand enough to evaluate their like object level decisions. But if you look at the Supreme Court or the Federal Reserve or something, <span class="ansi32">{+just from a distance, it seems+}</span> like they're really <span class="ansi31">[-well-run, company-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+well run, competent+}</span> organizations with highly technocratic,<span class="ansi31">[-you know. uh,-]</span> nonpartisan people running them.

I think both of <span class="ansi32">those</span> I don't think the <span class="ansi32">{+elections+}</span> point <span class="ansi31">[-this efficient-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+is sufficient+}</span> because there's plenty of unelected bodies that are totally <span class="ansi31">[-correct. world most-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+corrupt around the world.

So+}</span> I want to ask you about <span class="ansi32">{+sort of+}</span> certain potential <span class="ansi32">weaknesses</span> of the Democratic capitalist model that we live in. And in terms of <span class="ansi32">both</span> in terms of whether you<span class="ansi31">[-I-]</span> think they're <span class="ansi31">[-out of the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+object level+}</span> wrong, sorry, <span class="ansi31">[-I'm sure you're going to write.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+object level right.+}</span> And second, <span class="ansi32">how</span> regardless of how right they are, how persuasive and how <span class="ansi32">powerful a</span> force they will be against <span class="ansi32">{+our, you know, our economy.

Okay. So+}</span> there's a libertarian critique that basically democracy is sort of <span class="ansi32">{+a+}</span> random walk with a drift <span class="ansi31">[-toward-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+towards+}</span> socialism. And there's also a <span class="ansi31">[-ration of fact, we're going to program-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+ratchet effect where government programs don't go away.+}</span> And so it just ends up towards socialism at the end. It ends up with having government that <span class="ansi31">[-is---]</span><span class="ansi32">{+is too+}</span> large. <span class="ansi32">{+Yeah.+}</span> But I don't see the evidence that it's <span class="ansi31">[-wrote-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+road+}</span> to <span class="ansi31">[-surfed him.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+serfdom.+}</span> France, <span class="ansi32">sweden</span> have had pretty big <span class="ansi32">governments way</span> too <span class="ansi32">large</span> in my opinion. <span class="ansi32">{+But they+}</span> haven't threatened to <span class="ansi31">[-turn autocratic or totalitarian, certainly not. and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+turn.

It's more of a problem with regulation and the administrative <span class="ansi32">{+state.+}</span> But we've shown an ability to create new sectors like <span class="ansi31">[-the-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+big+}</span> parts of tech. <span class="ansi31">[-If they're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+They're+}</span> not <span class="ansi32">unregulated laws</span> apply to <span class="ansi32">them but</span> they're way less <span class="ansi32">regulated and</span> it's a kind of <span class="ansi31">[-Are that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+race.

So the critique should be taken seriously. <span class="ansi32">but</span> it's yet to be validated. How about the egalitarian critique from the <span class="ansi32">left</span> that you can't have the inequality the market creates with the political and moral <span class="ansi32">equality</span> that <span class="ansi31">[-the human's-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+humans+}</span> deserve and <span class="ansi32">demand</span> They just say that. <span class="ansi32">{+But what's the evidence?+}</span> US has high degree of income inequality. <span class="ansi31">[-Brazil, a-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+So does Brazil.

And what I have in mind is quite a bit of reality, the <span class="ansi31">[-universe.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+universe, might+}</span> in some very fundamental <span class="ansi32">way</span> simply not be <span class="ansi32">legible and</span> that there's no <span class="ansi31">[-easier in-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+easy and+}</span> fruitful way to <span class="ansi32">just</span> quote <span class="ansi32">unquote</span> apply more intelligence to the problem. <span class="ansi32">{+Like, oh, you want to integrate+}</span> general relativity and quantum <span class="ansi32">mechanics it</span> may just be <span class="ansi31">[-we fit-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+we've hit+}</span> the frontier. And there's not a final layer <span class="ansi31">[-of years that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of, oh, here's how+}</span> it fits together. So there's no way to train <span class="ansi31">[-and they...-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in AI+}</span> or other thing to make it smarter to solve that. And maybe a lot of the world is like <span class="ansi31">[-that and that to me people are not taking seriously enough so I'm not sure that and that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+that. And that,+}</span> to <span class="ansi32">me</span> people are not taking seriously <span class="ansi32">enough so</span> I'm not sure <span class="ansi31">[-with-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+what+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-and that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+net returns+}</span> will be to bigger and better and smarter AI. <span class="ansi32">{+That seems+}</span> possible for<span class="ansi31">[-you know-]</span> P versus NP type of <span class="ansi31">[-reasons and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+reasons. It's+}</span> just<span class="ansi31">[-like-]</span> harder to make <span class="ansi31">[-for their-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+further+}</span> discoveries. But I feel like we have pretty good <span class="ansi32">estimates in</span> terms of <span class="ansi32">{+like+}</span> the <span class="ansi31">[-declining. research-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+declining researcher+}</span> productivity because of <span class="ansi31">[-looking for-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+low hanging fruit+}</span> being <span class="ansi31">[-on-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+gone+}</span> in this sort of <span class="ansi31">[-sense.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+sense of+}</span> we're reaching the <span class="ansi32">frontier and</span> whatever percent it is a <span class="ansi32">year</span> if you can just keep the AI population growing faster than <span class="ansi32">that if</span> you just want to be crude about it, that seems enough to, if <span class="ansi32">not</span> get to the ultimate physical <span class="ansi32">synthesis</span> at least much <span class="ansi31">[-further-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+farther+}</span> than <span class="ansi31">[-we're-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+where+}</span> human <span class="ansi32">{+civilization+}</span> would get in the same span of time. That seems very <span class="ansi31">[-possible.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+plausible.+}</span> I think we'll get further. I expect <span class="ansi31">[-to be activity-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+big productivity+}</span> gains. As a side <span class="ansi32">note</span> I'm less convinced by the declining <span class="ansi31">[-research or-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+researcher+}</span> productivity argument <span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+than+}</span> I used to be. So the best way to measure productivity for an economist is <span class="ansi32">{+wages+}</span> and wages of researchers haven't gone down. <span class="ansi32">{+Period. In fact,+}</span> they've gone up. <span class="ansi32">now</span> they may not be producing new ideas. You might be <span class="ansi31">[-paying-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+paying them to be functionaries or to manage PR or to just manage other researchers. But I think that's a worry that we have a lot more researchers with generally working, but we're not going to be able to get+}</span> them to <span class="ansi31">[-be are-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the point where they're going+}</span> to <span class="ansi31">[-manage PR or do this manage other researchers. But-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+be working.+}</span> I think that's a worry that we have a lot <span class="ansi31">[-more researchers.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of researchers with+}</span> generally rising researcher wages and that hasn't boosted productivity growth. China, India, South Korea brought into the world economy, scientific talent. It's better than if we hadn't done it, but it hasn't in absolute terms boosted productivity <span class="ansi32">{+growth.+}</span> And maybe that's a worrisome sign.<span class="ansi31">[---]</span> On the metric <span class="ansi31">[-researcher.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+of researcher wages,+}</span> it seems like it could just be a fact that even the<span class="ansi31">[-even the-]</span> less marginally useful improvements are worth the extra cost in terms of if you think of <span class="ansi31">[-a company like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the company. Like+}</span> Google is probably paying as engineers a lot more than <span class="ansi31">[-I-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+it+}</span> was paying in the early days, even <span class="ansi31">[-that-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+though+}</span> they're doing less now. <span class="ansi31">[-I have-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Because+}</span> changing a pixel in the <span class="ansi31">[-view-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+new+}</span> Google page is going to affect billions of users. The similar thing could be happening <span class="ansi32">{+in the+}</span> economy, right? That might hold for Google researchers, but take people in <span class="ansi31">[-far-- environment, bio medicine. There's a lot of private sector for the medicine.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+pharma, biomedicine.+}</span> There's a lot of private sector <span class="ansi31">[-finance research. quickly-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+financed research or indirectly+}</span> financed by buying up smaller companies. And it only makes sense if you get something out of it that really <span class="ansi32">works</span> like a good vaccine or <span class="ansi32">{+a+}</span> good medication, <span class="ansi31">[-as epic-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Ozempic,+}</span> super profitable. So wages for biomedical researchers in general haven't <span class="ansi31">[-come-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+gone+}</span> down. Now finally it's paying <span class="ansi32">off</span> but I'm not sure <span class="ansi32">{+AI+}</span> will be as revolutionary as the other AI optimists believe. I do think it will raise productivity growth in ways which are visible. To what <span class="ansi31">[-extent... But-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+extent,+}</span> in the conventional growth story, you<span class="ansi31">[-would-]</span> think in terms of population size, right? <span class="ansi32">{+And then so+}</span> you just increase the population size, you get much more <span class="ansi31">[-research at the other end. To-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+research. And to+}</span> what extent does it make sense to think <span class="ansi32">about well</span> if you have these billions of AI copies, we <span class="ansi31">[-get to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+can+}</span> think of that in terms of as a proxy of how much progress they could produce. Is that<span class="ansi31">[-a-]</span> not a sensible way to think about that? <span class="ansi31">[-have millions-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+At some point, having billions+}</span> of copies probably won't matter. It will matter much more how good is the best thing we have and how well integrated is it into our other <span class="ansi31">[-systems.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+systems which+}</span> have bottlenecks of their own. And the principles governing the growth of that are much harder to discern. It's probably a much slower growth than just juicing <span class="ansi31">[-up.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+up, oh, we've got+}</span> a lot of these things and they're trained on more and more GPUs. But precisely <span class="ansi32">because</span> the top seems to matter so much is why we might expect bigger <span class="ansi31">[-gains.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+gains, right? So if you think about+}</span> Jews in the 20th century, 2% of <span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> population are less than that and 20% of the Nobel <span class="ansi31">[-Prize-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+prizes.+}</span> It does seem like you can have a much bigger impact than if you're on the very <span class="ansi31">[-tail.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+tail, if you just have+}</span> just a few hundred <span class="ansi31">[-ton of known-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+John Monnoyman+}</span> copies. Maybe that's a good <span class="ansi32">analogy</span> that the <span class="ansi31">[-active-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+impact of+}</span> AI will be <span class="ansi31">[-like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+like, oh, we're going to have a lot of AI. We're going to have a lot of AI. We're going to have a lot of AI. We're going to have a lot of AI. We're going to have a lot of AI. We're going to have a lot of AI. We're going to have a lot of AI. And then you have to think about, like,+}</span> in the 20th <span class="ansi32">century</span> the impact of <span class="ansi31">[-choose right. right yeah but-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+Jews. Right. Which would be excellent, right? Yeah. But+}</span> it's not <span class="ansi32">extraordinary its</span> not a science fiction <span class="ansi31">[-novel-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+novel. It is.+}</span> I <span class="ansi32">mean</span> you read the early 20th century <span class="ansi32">stuff</span> as you <span class="ansi31">[-have you know-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+have,+}</span> you <span class="ansi32">{+know,+}</span> it's like a slow <span class="ansi31">[-take off-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+takeoff+}</span> right there of <span class="ansi31">[-like-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+like, you know,+}</span> go from <span class="ansi31">[-V2 Rock is-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+B-2 rockets+}</span> to the moon <span class="ansi31">[-and-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+in+}</span> a couple of decades. <span class="ansi32">{+It's kind of a+}</span> crazy pace of change. <span class="ansi31">[-Yeah, that's what I think it will be like again.

Great stagnation is over. <span class="ansi31">[-We'll-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+People+}</span> go <span class="ansi31">[-back.-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+back to those+}</span> earlier rates of <span class="ansi32">change</span> transform a lot of the <span class="ansi32">world mostly</span> a big <span class="ansi32">positive a</span> lot of <span class="ansi31">[-us-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+chaos,+}</span> disrupted institutions along the way. That's my prediction. But no one writes a science <span class="ansi31">[-section-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+fiction+}</span> novel about the 20th century. It feels a bit ordinary still. <span class="ansi32">yeah even</span> though it wasn't. I forget the name of the philosopher you asked <span class="ansi31">[-us to-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+this to,+}</span> but <span class="ansi31">[-the... The-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+the+}</span> feminist <span class="ansi32">philosopher you</span> asked the question. <span class="ansi31">[-Let me ask you a question.

This seemed-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+AI, those seem+}</span> unlikely to me, but they're not logically impossible. <span class="ansi32">so</span> the fundamental premise <span class="ansi31">[-we're idea for-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+where I differ+}</span> from a lot of the <span class="ansi32">doomers</span> is my understanding of a decentralized world and its principles being primary. <span class="ansi32">{+Their+}</span> understanding is some kind of <span class="ansi32">comparison</span> like here's the little people and here's the big monster and the big monster gets <span class="ansi32">bigger and</span> even if the big monster does a lot of good <span class="ansi32">things</span> it's just getting <span class="ansi32">bigger and</span> here <span class="ansi32">{+are the little+}</span> people. That's a possible <span class="ansi32">framework but</span> if you start with decentralization and <span class="ansi31">[-and well-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+competition and, well,+}</span> how <span class="ansi32">{+are+}</span> we <span class="ansi31">[-can-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+going to+}</span> manage <span class="ansi31">[-this. always-]</span><span class="ansi32">{+this?

Yeah.+}</span> But you<span class="ansi31">[-don't...-]</span> don't just think you can wake up in the morning and<span class="ansi31">[-like-]</span> legislate safety.
